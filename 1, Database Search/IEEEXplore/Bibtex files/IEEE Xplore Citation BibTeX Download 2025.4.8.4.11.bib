  abstract={Free-viewpoint video allows the user to view objects from any virtual perspective, creating an immersive visual experience. This technology enhances the interactivity and freedom of multimedia performances. However, many free-viewpoint video synthesis methods hardly satisfy the requirement to work in real time with high precision, particularly for sports fields having large areas and numerous moving objects. To address these issues, we propose a free-viewpoint video synthesis method based on distance field acceleration. The central idea is to fuse multi-view distance field information and use it to adjust the search step size adaptively. Adaptive step size search is used in two ways: for fast estimation of multi-object three-dimensional surfaces, and synthetic view rendering based on global occlusion judgement. We have implemented our ideas using parallel computing for interactive display, using CUDA and OpenGL frameworks, and have used real-world and simulated experimental datasets for evaluation. The results show that the proposed method can render free-viewpoint videos with multiple objects on large sports fields at 25 fps. Furthermore, the visual quality of our synthetic novel viewpoint images exceeds that of state-of-the-art neural-rendering-based methods.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-14},
  abstract={The attention mechanism has gained significant prominence in visual-based object detection due to its outstanding efficiency and adaptability. This paper addresses the challenges of current Attention Mechanisms (AM) in traffic object detection tasks utilizing Camera-Radar Fusion (CRF) technology. A novel Multiple Attention Mechanism for Camera-Radar Fusion Object Detection (MAM-CRF) is proposed. A new network architecture is designed specifically for CRF networks to seamlessly integrate with existing vision-based AM modules. Additionally, an innovative Azimuth Attention Mechanism (AAM) module is developed, combining visual and radar data to enhance the network's focus on azimuthal features. A data scrambling technique is also introduced to reduce over-reliance on individual sensors in fusion-based methods. In the absence of a publicly available dataset tailored to this task, the Camera-Radar University of Washington (CRUW) dataset was selected and modified. Furthermore, a new dataset, the Camera-Radar Nanjing University of Science and Technology Version 1.0 (CRNJUST-v1.0), was created to validate the proposed methodology. Results demonstrate that MAM-CRF improves performance by over 2% with only a marginal complexity increase of 5%. The method also exhibits robust performance under severe data disturbances. Lightweight and portable, MAM-CRF is well-suited for a wide range of CRF applications.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Recent advancements in language models have greatly improved dialogue systems, but they still face challenges in generating personalized responses that are consistent with the user’s persona and dialogue context. Existing approaches typically model dialogue context and persona information together in a unified manner, but they lack fine-grained differentiation between the two, leading to inaccurate user modeling. This misalignment hinders the ability of dialogue systems to produce personalized responses. In this work, we propose CKE (Cross-Graph Knowledge Exchange), a novel algorithm designed to enhance personalized response generation in dialogue systems. CKE constructs separate dialogue user graphs for each party in the dialogue, representing both their dialogue context and persona information. These graphs are then utilized to perform cross-graph structured knowledge aggregation, where the aggregation is under supervised by both its own and the other party’s persona and dialogue context, providing richer, more accurate representations. Furthermore, CKE introduces a hybrid prompt template that combines both discrete and continuous elements, improving the language model’s ability to leverage graph-structured information. The experimental results demonstrate that CKE significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in generating more coherent, contextually appropriate, and personalized responses in dialogue systems.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Point clouds serve as the foundational representation of 3D objects, playing a pivotal role in both computer vision and computer graphics. Recently, the acquisition of point clouds has been effortless because of the development of hardware devices. However, the collected point clouds may be incomplete due to environmental conditions, such as occlusion. Therefore, completing partial point clouds becomes an essential task. The majority of current methods address point cloud completion via the utilization of shape priors. While these methods have demonstrated commendable performance, they often encounter challenges in preserving the global structural and geometric details of the 3D shape. In contrast to those mentioned earlier, we propose a novel cross-modal coarse-to-fine network (CMNet) for point cloud completion. Our method utilizes additional image information to provide global information, thus avoiding the loss of structure. To ensure that the generated results contain sufficient geometric details, we propose a coarse-to-fine learning approach based on multiple patches. Specifically, we encode the image and use multiple generators to generate multiple coarse patches, which are combined into a complete shape. Subsequently, based on the coarse patches generated in advance, we generate fine patches by combining partial point cloud information. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud completion.},

  abstract={The field of community detection has been expanding greatly since the 1980s, with a remarkable diversity of models and algorithms developed in different communities like machine learning, computer science, network science, social science, and statistical physics. Various fundamental questions remain nonetheless unsettled, such as: Are there really communities? Algorithms may output community structures, but are these meaningful or artefacts? Can we always extract the communities when they are present; fully, partially? And what is a good benchmark to measure the performance of algorithms, and how good are the current algorithms? This monograph describes recent developments aiming at answering these questions in the context of block models. Addressing the issues from an information-theoretic view-point, the author gives a comprehensive description of the historical and recent work that has led to key new concepts in the various recovery requirements for community detection. The monograph provides a compact introduction to community detection, which enables the reader to apply these techniques in applications such as understanding sociological behavior, protein to protein interactions; gene expressions; recommendation systems; medical prognosis; DNA 3D folding; image segmentation, natural language processing, product-customer segmentation, webpage sorting, and many more.},

  pages={17-24},
  abstract={An agent providing an information retrieval service may work with a corpus of text documents. The documents in the corpus may contain annotations such as Subjective Content Descriptions (SCD)—additional data associated with different sentences of the documents. Each SCD is associated with multiple sentences of the corpus and has relations among each other. The agent uses the SCDs to create its answers in response to user supplied queries. However, a user of the agent may not be the creator of the SCDs for the corpus. Hence, answers may be considered faulty by an agent’s user, because the SCDs may not exactly match the perceptions of an agent’s user. A naive and very costly approach would be to ask each user to completely create all the SCD themselves. To circumvent this, this paper presents ReFrESH, an approach for Relation-preserving Feedback-reliant Enhancement of SCDs by Humans. An agent’s user can give feedback about faulty answers to the agent. This feedback is then used by ReFrESH to update the SCDs incrementally. Using ReFrESH, SCDs can be refreshed with feedback by humans and it allows users to build even better SCDs for their needs.},

  abstract={The growth of the Internet has aroused people’s attention toward network security. A secure network environment is fundamental for the expeditious and impeccable development of the Internet. The majority of internet-based tasks can be completed with the help of a web browser. Although many web applications add browser extensions to improve their functionality, some of these extensions are malicious and can access sensitive data without the user’s knowledge. Browser extensions with malicious intent present a growing security concern and have quickly become one of the most prevalent methods used to compromise Internet security. This is largely due to their widespread usage and the extensive privileges they possess. After being installed, these malicious extensions are executed and make an attempt to compromise the victim’s browser. This makes them particularly elusive and challenging to combat. It is crucial to promptly develop an effective strategy to address the threats posed by these extensions. A comprehensive review of the research on browser extension vulnerabilities is presented in this paper. The role of malicious links in web browser extensions are examined for several attacks. Detection of malicious browser extension on various aspects are represented namely Intrusion malicious web browser extensions detection using Intrusion detection, Machine learning based detection methods and Deep learning based techniques to mitigate malicious web browser extensions are examined. This study investigates the critical function of malicious detection in protecting web browsers, looking at the changing threats and risk-reduction tactics. A robust cybersecurity frameworks can be created that not only respond to known threats but also anticipate and thwart the strategies of future cyber adversaries by realizing the significance of proactive detection. Thus this survey provides a detailed comparison of various solutions for malicious browser extension.},

  abstract={Automated visual recognition tasks such as image classification, image captioning, object detection and image segmentation are essential for image and video processing. Of these, image segmentation is the task of associating pixels in an image with their respective object class labels. It has a wide range of applications within many industries, including healthcare, transportation, robotics, fashion, home improvement, and tourism. In this monograph, both traditional and modern object segmentation approaches are investigated, comparing their strengths, weaknesses, and utilities. The main focus is on the deep learning-based techniques for the two most widely solved segmentation tasks: Semantic Segmentation and Instance Segmentation. A wide range of deep learning-based segmentation techniques developed in recent years are examined. Various themes emerge from these techniques that push machines to their limits, and often deviate from human perception principles. In addition, an overview of the widely used benchmark datasets for each of these techniques, along with the respective evaluation metrics to measure the models’ performances, are presented. Potential future research directions conclude the monograph. This monograph serves as a good introduction to the automated visual recognition task of image segmentation and is intended for students and professionals.},

  abstract={Recent rapid advancements in intelligent vehicular systems and deep learning techniques have led to the emergence of diverse applications utilizing high-quality automotive videos in the Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV), often assisted by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These applications aim to provide convenience and security for users. However, transmitting automotive videos with high-quality and low-bit-rate poses a challenge due to the inherent lossiness of traditional compression codecs in current UAV-assisted IoV systems, thereby affecting the performance of subsequent tasks. To address this, we propose a spatial-temporal hybrid video compression framework (STHVC), which integrates Space-Time Super-Resolution (STSR) with conventional codecs to enhance the compression efficiency on automotive videos. In our hybrid design, the encoder generates a low-frame-rate and low-resolution version of the source video, which is then compressed using a traditional codec. During the decoding stage, an effective STSR network is developed to increase both the resolution and the frame rate, and mitigate compression artifacts for automotive videos simultaneously. Additionally, we introduce a rectified intermediate flow estimation technique (RecIFE) within the proposed STSR network to address the challenge of noisy and inaccurate motions during the compression pipeline. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves bit-rate reductions of 29.97% compared to H.265 (slow) and 31.27% compared to H.266, while also exhibiting superior restoration performance compared to other state-of-the-art learning-based approaches.},

  abstract={Reconstructing urban street scenes is crucial due to its vital role in applications such as autonomous driving and urban planning. These scenes are characterized by long, narrow camera trajectories, occlusion, complex object relationships, and sparse data across multiple scales. Despite recent advancements, existing surface reconstruction methods, which are primarily designed for object-centric scenarios, struggle to adapt effectively to the unique characteristics of street scenes. To address this challenge, we introduce StreetSurfGS, the first method to employ Gaussian Splatting specifically tailored for scalable urban street scene surface reconstruction. StreetSurfGS utilizes a planar-based octree representation and segmented training to reduce memory costs, accommodate unique camera characteristics, and improve scalability. Additionally, to mitigate depth inaccuracies caused by object overlap, we propose a guided smoothing strategy within regularization to eliminate inaccurate boundary points and outliers. Furthermore, to address sparse views and multi-scale challenges, we use a dual-step matching strategy that leverages adjacent and long-term information. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of StreetSurfGS in both novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction.},

  title={Color Decoupling for Multi-Illumination Color Constancy}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Current multi-illumination color constancy methods typically estimate illumination for each pixel directly. However, according to the multi-illumination imaging equation, the color of each pixel is determined by various components, including the innate color of the scene content, the colors of multiple illuminations, and the weightings of these illuminations. Failing to distinguish between these components results in color coupling. On the one hand, there is color coupling between illumination and scene content, where estimations are easily misled by the colors of the content, and the distribution of the estimated illuminations is relatively scattered. On the other hand, there is color coupling between illuminations, where estimations are susceptible to interference from high-frequency and heterogeneous illumination colors, and the local contrast is low. To address color coupling, we propose a Color Decoupling Network (CDNet) that includes a Content Color Awareness Module (CCAM) and a Contrast HArmonization Module (CHAM). CCAM learns scene content color priors, decoupling the colors of content and illuminations by providing the model with the color features of the content, thereby reducing out-of-gamut estimations and enhancing consistency. CHAM constrains feature representation, decoupling illuminants by mutual calibration between adjacent features. CHAM utilizes spatial correlation to make the model more sensitive to the relationships between neighboring features and utilizes illumination disparity degree to guide feature classification. By enhancing the uniqueness of homogeneous illumination features and the distinctiveness of heterogeneous illumination features, CHAM improves local edge contrast. Additionally, by allocating fine-grained margin coefficients to emphasize the soft distinctiveness of similar illumination features, further enhancing local contrast. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-illumination benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance.},

  abstract={A graduate-level text that examines the semiclassical approach to quantum mechanicsPhysical systems have been traditionally described in terms of either classical or quantum mechanics. But in recent years, semiclassical methods have developed rapidly, providing deep physical insight and computational tools for quantum dynamics and spectroscopy. In this book, Eric Heller introduces and develops this subject, demonstrating its power with many examples.  In the first half of the book, Heller covers relevant aspects of classical mechanics, building from them the semiclassical way through the semiclassical limit of the Feynman path integral. The second half of the book applies this approach to various kinds of spectroscopy, such as molecular spectroscopy and electron imaging and quantum dynamical systems with an emphasis on tunneling. Adopting a distinctly time-dependent viewpoint, Heller argues for semiclassical theories from experimental and theoretical vantage points valuable to research in physics and chemistry. Featuring more than two hundred figures, the book provides a geometric, phase-space, and coordinate-space pathway to greater understanding.Filled with practical examples and applications, The Semiclassical Way to Dynamics and Spectroscopy is a comprehensive presentation of the tools necessary to successfully delve into this unique area of quantum mechanics.A comprehensive approach for using classical mechanics to do quantum mechanicsMore than two hundred figures to assist intuitionEmphasis on semiclassical Green function and wave packet perspective, as well as tunneling and spectroscopyChapters include quantum mechanics of classically chaotic systems, quantum scarring, and other modern dynamical topics},

  pages={404-434},
  abstract={Deep learning, as an important branch of machine learning, has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and more. However, recent studies have revealed that deep learning systems are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Backdoor attackers inject a hidden backdoor into the deep learning model, such that the predictions of the infected model will be maliciously changed if the hidden backdoor is activated by input with a backdoor trigger while behaving normally on any benign sample. This kind of attack can potentially result in severe consequences in the real world. Therefore, research on defending against backdoor attacks has emerged rapidly. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of backdoor attacks, detections, and defenses previously demonstrated on deep learning. We have investigated widely used model architectures, benchmark datasets, and metrics in backdoor research and have classified attacks, detections and defenses based on different criteria. Furthermore, we have analyzed some limitations in existing methods and, based on this, pointed out several promising future research directions. Through this survey, beginners can gain a preliminary understanding of backdoor attacks and defenses. Furthermore, we anticipate that this work will provide new perspectives and inspire extra research into the backdoor attack and defense methods in deep learning.},

This monograph develops a comprehensive statistical learning framework that uses Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) under the Wasserstein metric to ensure robustness to perturbations in the data. The authors introduce the reader to the fundamental properties of the Wasserstein metric and the DRO formulation, before explaining the theory in detail and its application. They cover a series of learning problems, including (i) distributionally robust linear regression; (ii) distributionally robust regression with group structure in the predictors; (iii) distributionally robust multi-output regression and multiclass classification; (iv) optimal decision making that combines distributionally robust regression with nearest-neighbor estimation; (v) distributionally robust semi-supervised learning; (vi) distributionally robust reinforcement learning. Throughout the monograph, the authors use applications in medicine and health care to illustrate the theoretical ideas in practice. They include numerical experiments and case studies using synthetic and real data. Distributionally Robust Learning provides a detailed insight into a technique that has gained a lot of recent interest in developing robust supervised learning solutions that are founded in sound mathematical principles.

  abstract={We address the critical problem of interference rejection in radio-frequency (RF) signals using a data-driven approach that leverages deep-learning methods. A primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of the RF Challenge, which is a publicly available, diverse RF signal dataset for data-driven analyses of RF signal problems. Specifically, we adopt a simplified signal model for developing and analyzing interference rejection algorithms. For this signal model, we introduce a set of carefully chosen deep learning architectures, incorporating key domain-informed modifications alongside traditional benchmark solutions to establish baseline performance metrics for this intricate, ubiquitous problem. Through extensive simulations involving eight different signal mixture types, we demonstrate the superior performance (in some cases, by two orders of magnitude) of architectures such as UNet and WaveNet over traditional methods like matched filtering and linear minimum mean square error estimation. Our findings suggest that the data-driven approach can yield scalable solutions, in the sense that the same architectures may be similarly trained and deployed for different types of signals. Moreover, these findings further corroborate the promising potential of deep learning algorithms for enhancing communication systems, particularly via interference mitigation. This work also includes results from an open competition based on the RF Challenge, hosted at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP’24).},

  year={2024},
  volume={10},
  number={6},
  pages={1185-1204},
  abstract={We present a novel framework for audio-guided localized image stylization. Sound often provides information about the specific context of a scene and is closely related to a certain part of the scene or object. However, existing image stylization works have focused on stylizing the entire image using an image or text input. Stylizing a particular part of the image based on audio input is natural but challenging. This work proposes a framework in which a user provides an audio input to localize the target in the input image and another to locally stylize the target object or scene. We first produce a fine localization map using an audio-visual localization network leveraging CLIP embedding space. We then utilize an implicit neural representation (INR) along with the predicted localization map to stylize the target based on sound information. The INR manipulates local pixel values to be semantically consistent with the provided audio input. Our experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms other audio-guided stylization methods. Moreover, we observe that our method constructs concise localization maps and naturally manipulates the target object or scene in accordance with the given audio input.},

  abstract={Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) is the task of answering natural language questions that involve extracting and combining multiple pieces of information and doing multiple steps of reasoning. The ability to answer multi-hop questions and perform multi-step reasoning can significantly improve the utility of NLP systems. But the notion of ‘multiple hops’ is somewhat abstract which results in a large variety of tasks that require multi-hop reasoning. This leads to different datasets and models that differ significantly from each other and makes the field challenging to generalize and survey. In this monograph, the authors provide a general and formal definition of the MHQA task, and organize and summarize existing MHQA frameworks. They also outline some best practices for building MHQA datasets. This monograph provides a systematic and thorough introduction to Multi-Hop Question Answering that is becoming increasingly important in practical AI systems.},

  year={2023},
  volume={9},

  pages={531-550},
  abstract={Professional dance is characterized by high impulsiveness, elegance, and aesthetic beauty. In order to reach the desired professionalism, it requires years of long and exhausting practice, good physical condition, musicality, but also, a good understanding of choreography. Capturing dance motions and transferring them to digital avatars is commonly used in the film and entertainment industries. However, so far, access to high-quality dance data is very limited, mainly due to the many practical difficulties in capturing the movements of dancers, making it prohibitive for large-scale data acquisition. In this paper, we present a model that enhances the professionalism of amateur dance movements, allowing movement quality to be improved in both spatial and temporal domains. Our model consists of a dance-to-music alignment stage responsible for learning the optimal temporal alignment path between dance and music, and a dance-enhancement stage that injects features of professionalism in both spatial and temporal domains. To learn a homogeneous distribution and credible mapping between the heterogeneous professional and amateur datasets, we generate amateur data from professional dances taken from the AIST++ dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with two baseline motion transfer methods via thorough qualitative visual controls, quantitative metrics, and a perceptual study. We also provide temporal and spatial module analysis to examine the mechanisms and necessity of key components of our framework.},

  abstract={Textual documents, such as manuscripts and historical newspapers, make up an important part of our cultural heritage. Massive digitization projects have been conducted across the globe for a better preservation of, and for providing easier access to such, often vulnerable, documents. These digital counterparts also allow to unlock the rich information contained inside and across them thanks to various types of computational models for document image understanding. In this article, we will shed a light on the document image processing pipeline, from scan to information extraction. As it turns out, human perceptual-driven algorithms are among the most powerful approaches for generic document image understanding, required to deal with a myriad of layouts. In this context, we will in particular explain Gestalt visioning and the linked concept of text homogeneity that allows for enhanced layout analysis and even damage recognition, especially relevant in a cultural heritage setting. We conclude with a recent promising development, namely joint visual and language processing, that will take document image understanding to the next level in the future.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={High-resolution (HR) videos have gained popularity with the widespread adoption of high-definition displays. Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to recover HR frames from low-resolution (LR) frames. While deep neural network (DNN)-based SR methods have outperformed traditional techniques in quality, they face performance challenges. FPGA-based SR accelerators have been developed to optimize the performance and power efficiency. However, most of these accelerators process only uncompressed video frames and perform per-frame DNN inference, overlooking the temporal-spatial information inherent in compressed video bitstreams. We propose a novel compressed video SR workflow that includes a codec information reuse algorithm and a dedicated FPGA accelerator named Co-ViSu. Our approach leverages the observation that non-key frames can be reconstructed using codec information and HR key-frames, significantly reducing DNN computations. The Co-ViSu algorithm employs sub-pixel interpolation to enhance high-frequency details and an MV-aware method to improve SR reconstruction quality. The Co-ViSu hardware integrates decoder, SR, and encoder engines within a parallel pipeline architecture, utilizing codec information reuse to bypass non-key frame decoding, eliminate complex DNN computations, and accelerate encoding processes. Experimental results demonstrate that Co-ViSu achieves performance improvements ranging from 3.6x to 9.4x and a 4.2x gain in energy efficiency with minimal quality loss compared to traditional flow. Additionally, Co-ViSu offers a 2.1x increase in throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

  booktitle={Semantics for Robotic Mapping, Perception and Interaction: A Survey},
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={For robots to navigate and interact more richly with the world around them, they will likely require a deeper understanding of the world in which they operate. In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world ‘mean’ to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys were published. This survey provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories, we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics such as mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The survey also covers key practical considerations, including enablers like increased data availability and improved computational hardware, and major application areas where semantics is or is likely to play a key role. In creating this survey, we hope to provide researchers across academia and industry with a comprehensive reference that helps facilitate future research in this exciting field.},

  booktitle={An Introduction to Deep Survival Analysis Models for Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes},
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={The earliest research into time-to-event outcomes can be dated back to the 17th century. Here the initial focus was predicting time until death, hence the term survival analysis. Applications of time-to-event outcomes are to be found in many walks of life, such as insurance, medicine, and even calculating when will a customer end their subscription. Recently, the machine learning community has made significant methodological advances in survival analysis that take advantage of the representation learning ability of deep neural networks. At this point, there is a proliferation of deep survival analysis models. In this monograph, the author provides a self-contained modern introduction to survival analysis. The focus is on predicting time-to-event outcomes at the individual data point level with the help of neural networks. They provide the reader with a working understanding of precisely what the basic time-to-event prediction problem is, how it differs from standard regression and classification, and how key “design patterns” have been used time after time to derive new time-to-event prediction models. The author also details two extensions of the basic time-to-event prediction setup, namely the competing risks setting and the dynamic setting. The monograph concludes with a discussion of a variety of topics such as fairness, causal reasoning, interpretability, and statistical guarantees. This timely monograph provides researchers and students with a succinct introduction to the use of time-to-event outcomes in modern artificial intelligence driven systems.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Since the popularisation of the Internet in the 1990s, the cyberspace has kept evolving. We have created various computer-mediated virtual environments, including social networks, video conferencing, virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR Chat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokémon Go), and Non-Fungible Token Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and unconnected, have brought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term ‘metaverse’ has been coined to facilitate further digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital ‘big bang’ of our cyberspace is not far away. This monograph presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital ‘big bang’. It is essential to highlight that the metaverse encompasses diverse technologies and ecosystems, calling it an interdisciplinary and emerging field. Its primary objective is to provide users with satisfactory and interactive experiences. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. Eight enabling technologies are rigorously examined - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, six user-centric factors are discussed – Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy, Social Acceptability, Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability. Finally, a concrete research agenda is examined for developing the metaverse.},

  title={Multi-Frequency Nonlinear Methods for 3D Shape Measurement of Semi-Transparent Surfaces Using Projector-Camera Systems}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-13},
  abstract={Measuring the 3D shape of semi-transparent surfaces with projector-camera 3D scanners is a difficult task because these surfaces weakly reflect light in a diffuse manner, and transmit a large part of the incident light. The task is even harder in the presence of participating background surfaces. The two methods proposed in this paper use sinusoidal patterns, each with a frequency chosen in the frequency range allowed by the projection optics of the projector-camera system. They differ in the way in which the camera-projector correspondence map is established, as well as in the number of patterns and the processing time required. The first method utilizes the discrete Fourier transform, performed on the intensity signal measured at a camera pixel, to inventory projector columns illuminating directly and indirectly the scene point imaged by that pixel. The second method goes beyond discrete Fourier transform and achieves the same goal by fitting a proposed analytical model to the measured intensity signal. Once the one (camera pixel) to many (projector columns) correspondence is established, a surface continuity constraint is applied to extract the one to one correspondence map linked to the semi-transparent surface. This map is used to determine the 3D point cloud of the surface by triangulation. Experimental results demonstrate the performance (accuracy, reliability) achieved by the proposed methods.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={The 5th generation (5G) of wireless systems is being deployed with the aim to provide many sets of wireless communication services, such as low data rates for a massive amount of devices, broadband, low latency, and industrial wireless access. Such an aim is even more complex in the next generation wireless systems (6G) where wireless connectivity is expected to serve any connected intelligent unit, such as software robots and humans interacting in the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, drones, trains, or smart sensors monitoring cities, buildings, and the environment. As the wireless devices will be orders of magnitude denser than in 5G cellular systems, and due to the complex quality of service requirements, the access to the wireless spectrum will have to be appropriately shared to avoid congestion, poor quality of service, or unsatisfactory communication delays. Spectrum sharing methods have been the objective of intense study through model-based approaches, such as optimization or game theories. However, these methods may fail when facing the complexity of the communication environments in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application and development of data-driven methods, namely machine learning methods, to handle the complex operation of spectrum sharing. In this monograph, a complete overview of the state-of-the-art of machine learning for spectrum sharing is provided. First, the authors map the most prominent methods that are encountered in spectrum sharing. Then, it is shown how these machine learning methods are applied to the numerous dimensions and sub-problems of spectrum sharing, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum access, and spectrum handoff. Finally, several open questions and future trends are highlighted.},

  abstract={Chaos and Dynamical Systems presents an accessible, clear introduction to dynamical systems and chaos theory, important and exciting areas that have shaped many scientific fields. While the rules governing dynamical systems are well-specified and simple, the behavior of many dynamical systems is remarkably complex. Of particular note, simple deterministic dynamical systems produce output that appears random and for which long-term prediction is impossible. Using little math beyond basic algebra, David Feldman gives readers a grounded, concrete, and concise overview.In initial chapters, Feldman introduces iterated functions and differential equations. He then surveys the key concepts and results to emerge from dynamical systems: chaos and the butterfly effect, deterministic randomness, bifurcations, universality, phase space, and strange attractors. Throughout, Feldman examines possible scientific implications of these phenomena for the study of complex systems, highlighting the relationships between simplicity and complexity, order and disorder.Filling the gap between popular accounts of dynamical systems and chaos and textbooks aimed at physicists and mathematicians, Chaos and Dynamical Systems will be highly useful not only to students at the undergraduate and advanced levels, but also to researchers in the natural, social, and biological sciences.},

  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Binary detection is a ubiquitous problem in virtually all branches of science and technology. In many cases, binary detection must be carried out in a setting wherein the presence of an adversary aiming at inducing a wrong decision cannot be ruled out. Applications include network monitoring, spam filtering, multimedia forensics, video surveillance and biometric authentication to name but a few. In these cases, the attack is carried out at the time of testing. With the advent of widespread machine learning tools, the attacker can act during the learning phase, making it harder to detect. The main idea behind adversarial detection theory is to cast the detection problem into a game-theoretic framework. This allows the goals and the actions available to the two contenders to be rigorously defined. In this monograph, the authors address several variants of a general adversarial binary detection problem, depending on the knowledge available to the Defender and the Attacker of the statistical characterization of a system. They lead the reader through the considerations and solutions under two hypotheses, using a framework that can be adopted in many applications. This monograph, aimed at students, researchers and practitioners working in the application areas who want an accessible introduction to the theory behind Adversarial Binary Detection and the possible solutions to their particular problem.},

  abstract={As robots and other intelligent agents move from simple environments and problems to more complex, unstructured settings, manually programming their behavior has become increasingly challenging and expensive. Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. An Algorithmic Perspective on Imitation Learning provides the reader with an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. An Algorithmic Perspective on Imitation Learning serves two audiences. First, it familiarizes machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, it provides roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence with a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. It pays particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction.},

  abstract={Humans perceive the world through many channels, such as images viewed by the eyes, or voices heard by the ears. Though any individual channel might be incomplete or noisy, humans can naturally align and fuse information collected from multiple channels in order to grasp the key concepts needed for a better understanding of the world. One of the core aspirations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to develop algorithms that endow computers with an ability to effectively learn from multimodal (or, multi-channel) data. This data is similar to sights and sounds attained from vision and language that help humans make sense of the world around us. For example, computers could mimic this ability by searching the most relevant images to a text query (or vice versa), and by describing the content of an image using natural language. Vision-and-Language (VL), a popular research area that sits at the nexus of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to achieve this goal. This monograph surveys vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods for multimodal intelligence that have been developed in the last few years. Approaches are grouped into three categories: (i) VLP for image-text tasks, such as image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and visual grounding; (ii) VLP for core computer vision tasks, such as (open-set) image classification, object detection, and segmentation; and (iii) VLP for video-text tasks, such as video captioning, video-text retrieval, and video question answering. For each category, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods is presented, and the progress that has been made and challenges still being faced are discussed, using specific systems and models as case studies. In addition, for each category, advanced topics being actively explored in the research community are presented, such as big foundation models, unified modeling, in-context few-shot learning, knowledge, robustness, and computer vision in the wild, to name a few.},

  abstract={Diffusion-based image editing involves both preserving the source image content and generating new content or applying modifications. Although current editing approaches have made improvements under text guidance, they have two key drawbacks: overemphasis on retaining original image info, neglecting editability and text alignment, and inability to handle both structure-consistent and non-rigid editing tasks. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot image editing method, named Enhance Editability for text-based image Editing via Efficient CLIP guidance (E4C), which presents an innovative adaptive feature sharing mechanism to enable multi-task editing. Additionally, a novel random gateway mechanism is designed to efficiently introduce CLIP guidance into the multi-step sampling of diffusion, achieving high congruence between editing results and target text. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method effectively resolves the text alignment issues prevalent in existing methods while maintaining the fidelity to the source image, and performs well across a wide range of editing tasks.},

  year={2025},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={Space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN) have attracted considerable attention owing to their capability extending telecommunication coverage via satellite communication. They enhance the capacity and coverage of satellite communication systems using amplifying relays deployed in high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) in the air. Free-space optical (FSO) communication, which offers larger capacity compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) communication, can enhance the capacity of SAGIN to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6 G) systems. This study assumes a hybrid FSO/RF SAGIN, where high-capacity but atmospherically unstable FSO communications and low-capacity but atmospherically stable RF communications are used in a complementary manner in the satellite-HAPS-ground link. For the SAGIN coverage area to expand, the transmission capacity of the system needs to be further improved. Therefore, efficient use of the limited RF link frequency bandwidth is crucial, and the satellite and HAPS must cooperate to share and meet ground traffic requirements by controlling the areas they each cover. In addition, HAPS placement significantly impacts the spectral efficiency of the system because the positional relationship between the satellite and HAPS affects the transmission capacity. Therefore, this study proposes a combined control method for optimizing HAPS placement and coverage area of the satellite and HAPS. Furthermore, a solution space reduction method is incorporated into the proposed method for efficient exploration of the optimal control parameters. The solution exploration efficiency and data transmission performance using the proposed method are evaluated through simulations.},

  abstract={Printed electronics (PE) is an additive fabrication technology for manufacturing electronic circuits which not only allows for a highly flexible printing of arbitrary circuit patterns, but also produce soft, non-toxic, and degradable electronics at an extremely low cost. These properties are unmatched by silicon based electronics, making PE an enabler of new application domains, e.g., fast moving consumer goods, wearables, and disposable healthcare devices. A particularly promising class of circuits in this technology is the printed analog neuromorphic circuits, offering efficient and highly tailored computational functionalities. In this work, we leverage the highly flexible fabrication process of PE to address the bottleneck of PE, i.e., the large feature sizes and low device counts. This issue is crucial, as it impairs the integration of printed circuits into target applications with limited footprint, such as smart band aids. We also propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to improve the circuit compactness through circuit architecture optimization. As baseline, we compare the proposed EA method with a state-of-the-art pruning method and a modified area-aware pruning method. All of them are able to optimize circuit architecture alongside the component values of printed neuromorphic circuits. Experimental simulation reveals that the proposed EA approach can effectively achieve compact circuits and outperform the pruning method by 3.1× lower area with no loss of accuracy. As a byproduct, the power is reduced by 3.0×, paving the way to energy-harvested printed systems.},

  abstract={A key strategy in machine learning is to break down a problem into smaller and more manageable parts, then process data or unknown variables recursively. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is a technique for solving statistical inference problems recursively. Over the last 20 years, SMC has been developed to enabled inference in increasingly complex and challenging models in Signal Processing and Statistics. This monograph shows how the powerful technique can be applied to machine learning problems such as probabilistic programming, variational inference and inference evaluation to name a few. Written in a tutorial style, Elements of Sequential Monte Carlo introduces the basics of SMC, discusses practical issues, and reviews theoretical results before guiding the reader through a series of advanced topics to give a complete overview of the topic and its application to machine learning problems. This monograph provides an accessible treatment for researchers of a topic that has recently gained significant interest in the machine learning community.},

  abstract={Image Forgery Detection and Localization is rapidly advancing in the field of computer vision. Most methods locate forged regions in the form of segmentation and subsequently perform detection, facing challenges such as false detections (i.e., FPs) and inaccurate boundaries. In this work, we suggest rethinking the Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL) task from a regression perspective and propose the CatmullRom Splines-based Regression Network (CSR-Net) to address these issues. Specifically, we first design an adaptive CutmullRom splines fitting scheme to predict coarse forged regions. Subsequently, we develop a novel rescoring mechanism that filters out samples with no response in both the classification and instance branches to reduce false positives. Besides, a learnable texture extraction module decouples horizontal and vertical forgery features, extracting more robust contour representations to further refine boundaries and suppress false detections. Compared to segmentation-based methods our method is simple but effective due to the unnecessity of post-processing. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Particularly, CSR-Net achieves optimal performance on three real-world datasets, indicating the applicability of our method to real scenarios such as social media and multi-tampered regions.},
