  title = {On the Trustworthiness Landscape of State-of-the-art Generative Models: A Survey and Outlook},
  year = {2025},
  journal = {International Journal of Computer Vision},
  abstract = {Diffusion models and large language models have emerged as leading-edge generative models, revolutionizing various aspects of human life. However, their practical implementation has also exposed inherent risks, bringing to light their potential downsides and sparking concerns about their trustworthiness. Despite the wealth of literature on this subject, a comprehensive survey that specifically delves into the intersection of large-scale generative models and their trustworthiness remains largely absent. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates both long-standing and emerging threats associated with these models across four fundamental dimensions: 1) privacy, 2) security, 3) fairness, and 4) responsibility. Based on our investigation results, we develop an extensive survey that outlines the trustworthiness of large generative models. Following that, we provide practical recommendations and identify promising research directions for generative AI, ultimately promoting the trustworthiness of these models and benefiting society as a whole.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of digital music distribution has led to the emergence of new challenges in protecting the rights of musicians and copyright holders. This research paper presents a novel approach to designing a music copyright management system based on deep belief networks (DBNs) and blockchain technology. The integration of these two technologies provides a robust solution for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of copyrighted music content in the digital world. DBNs are utilized to extract meaningful features from music data and accurately classify it, enabling the identification and tracking of copyrighted content. The ability of DBNs to learn complex patterns and representations enhances the system's capability to detect unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted music. Blockchain technology is employed to provide a decentralized and secure platform for recording and managing copyright-related transactions. Cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures are utilized to ensure data integrity and authenticity. The immutable and tamper-proof nature of the blockchain establishes a reliable and verifiable record of ownership and licensing for copyrighted music. The storage efficiency of our system is optimized through the use of lightweight verifier and Merkle proofs. By storing only block headers and utilizing Merkle proofs for verification, the system minimizes storage overhead while maintaining the ability to validate the integrity of transactions. This optimization contributes to the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the system. Through this research, a comprehensive music copyright management system is introduced, offering a secure framework for detecting and preventing copyright infringement. The integration of DBNs and blockchain technology provides a robust solution for securing the rights of musicians and ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights in the digital music landscape.},

  year = {2024},
  journal = {Progress in Artificial Intelligence},
  abstract = {Significant accomplishments in many agricultural applications during the past decade attest to the fast progress and use of deep learning and machine learning methods in agricultural systems. However, these conventional models have a few drawbacks: They are not generalizable since they are trained on large, costly labeled datasets, require expert expertise to create and maintain, and are often built for specific applications. Significant accomplishments in language, vision, and decision-making tasks across several domains have been shown recently by massive pre-trained models, also known as large models (LMs). Recent years have seen large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable competence in a variety of fields, including natural language processing (NLP), by encompassing different advancements in terms of architecture, training methods, context duration, fine-tuning, multi-modality, datasets, efficiency, benchmarking, and many other. The massive amounts of data used to train these models span many domains and modalities. After training, they can handle a wide range of tasks with less tweaking and less task-specific labeled data. Despite its effectiveness and promising future, agricultural artificial intelligence (AAI) has received less attention than other applications of LLMs. To better understand the problem area and open up new research pathways in this sector, this work aims to examine the possibilities of LLMs in smart agriculture by offering conceptual tools and a technical base. Herein, we delve into the potential applications of large models in agriculture, primarily categorizing them into four categories: Agricultural applications of large language models (LLMs), large vision models (LVMs) for precise agricultural applications, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and model assessment, and intelligent and precise agriculture using reinforcement learning large models (RLLMs). Further, we review some of the most prominent LLMs, including three famous LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, PaLM), and discuss their characteristics, contributions, and limitations. Next, we evaluate famous LLM evaluation metrics and look at datasets for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation. Finally, we focus our discussion on issues and possible future research directions of LLMs in the agricultural sector. This review article aims to provide academics and practitioners with a panoramic perspective of the field and a quick reference to help them draw out relevant ideas from the extensive summaries of prior publications to broaden their LLM research.},

abstract="The development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) presents significant ethical and privacy issues that need to be carefully considered as it opens up previously unheard-of opportunities for creativity, automation, and problem-solving. This chapter explores the convergence of technology, society, and privacy as it digs into the complex world of ethical issues surrounding the use of generative AI. A wide range of concerns falls under the category of ethical considerations, such as the potential for social injustices to be amplified, biases present in training data, and the moral implications of content produced by artificial intelligence. This chapter explores how biases in training datasets might unintentionally reinforce societal preconceptions and provide discriminating results in AI-generated applications. Additionally, it looks at how organizations and developers can help reduce prejudice and guarantee fairness in generative AI systems. The chapter also explores the implications AI-generated content has for society, from text and images to full stories. The ethical implications of producing and sharing content that conflates real and artificial intelligence bring up issues with inaccuracy, manipulation, and potentially harmful applications. With a focus on protecting individual privacy, the chapter examines the fine line that must be drawn between fostering innovation and ensuring the welfare of society. Regarding privacy, the chapter discusses the risks posed by generative artificial intelligence, especially about safeguarding personal information. The chapter examines the possibility of privacy being exploited by creating synthetic content and highlights the necessity of strong security measures to prevent nefarious actors from compromising personal data. The chapter also encourages a proactive approach to addressing these issues by outlining developing best practices and current frameworks for ethical AI development. To create a responsible AI ecosystem that puts individual privacy first, it offers methods for incorporating explainability, accountability, and transparency into Generative AI systems. This chapter seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the direction of AI development by critically analyzing the ethical and privacy issues surrounding generative AI. To fully realize the transformational potential of generative AI while avoiding unforeseen repercussions, it emphasizes the significance of an ethical foundation and strong privacy safeguards.",

  year = {2025},
  journal = {AI & SOCIETY},
  abstract = {Whether supplementing written articles in newspapers or playing a leading role in photo-reporting, photography has achieved an influencial role in the delivery of information and framing of narratives to mass audiences. Photojournalism archives represent a unique source of historical data and public records about local, national, and international events, political movements, demonstrations, and urban development. This paper outlines a data archaeology project that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for organizing and searching through photojournalism collections, based on the Boston Globe photograph morgue. While the primary goal of the project is to foster public access to news archives, the large-scale digitization and recovery of information from photojournalism collections raises ethical questions about intellectual property and the right to identity protection when records are made available online. We present a proof of concept that tackles these issues by means of AI, while still offering equitable access to journalism archives that are often kept inaccessible within private media institutions. The first part of the paper discusses how machine learning can resolve the lack of resources to parse through data on digital surrogates. After providing an introduction to the use of ML to facilitate access to information in the Boston Globe photograph morgue, we outline two partially automated computational tasks: (1) an AI toolkit for transcribing archivists’ notes and to recover photographers’ names and creation dates, which can be used by librarians and archivists to assess copyright on records; (2) a pipeline for face detection and blurring that detects areas where identifiable people are present and allows for anonymization. As news archiving is confronted with challenges derived from the “digital heap” of orphaned data, privatization, and other barriers to journalism records, this report explores an ethical approach to structuring data in news archives for public access, by preserving intellectual property and privacy.},

pages="151--163",
abstract="Obfuscation is a method that safeguards intellectual property rights against malicious analysts by altering the structure, logic, and other aspects of a program. However, malicious developers utilize obfuscation methods in their malware to avoid detection and analysis. To deobfuscate malware, analysts leverage their analysis skills alongside deobfuscation methodology. Although obfuscation is widely used in malware, heuristic-based deobfuscation methodology has limitations, including reliance on specific obfuscation tools and inefficiency in large-scale processing. In this paper, we propose ChatDEOB, an effective deobfuscation method that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM). We focus on the LLM's application in various software engineering areas, such as code analysis, generation, and fuzzing, and employ it in our deobfuscation method. To effectively deobfuscate, we fine-tune the LLM model in detail and implement ChatDEOB using well-designed prompt engineering methods. To the best of our knowledge, ChatDEOB is the first method to deobfuscate code using a fine-tuned LLM model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatDEOB, we utilize SacreBLEU, a published obfuscation evaluation method, along with the Obfuscation Quality Quantification Framework. The experiment resulted in the SacreBLEU score increasing from an initial average of 22.71 to 49.12, achieving a 116.27{\%} improvement and demonstrating significant effectiveness. Additionally, when measuring the six evaluation indicators of the Obfuscation Quality Quantification Framework, the deobfuscation effect shows an average improvement of 85{\%} compared to the obfuscated code.",

Defending DNN models against IP violations such as illegal usage, replication, and reproduction is particularly important to the healthy development of deep learning techniques. Many approaches have been developed to protect the DNN model IP, such as DNN watermarking, DNN fingerprinting, DNN authentication, and inference perturbation. Given its significant importance, DNN IP protection is still in its infancy stage. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the existing DNN IP protection approaches. We first summarize the deployment mode for DNN models and describe the DNN IP protection problem. Then we categorize the existing protection approaches based on their protection strategies and introduce them in detail.

We cannot rely on the content the generative AI models may generate when the user prompts to generate the content. To generate fair and safe content the input prompt should be analyzed before generating the content to avoid generating unsafe content. If the prompt is unsafe the filters should avoid such a prompt or replace the improper and unsuitable words with the proper and suitable words. Here, we provide a framework for analyzing the text prompts based on the content moderation taxonomy. We define the taxonomy for content moderation and explore different language models to classify the prompt as per the moderation taxonomy.

Generative AI is used for creating new contents, and Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Model (LMMs) are a type of generative AI. Most modern AI chatbots are designed using LLMs and LMMs, which provide them with the power of generative AI. LLMs deal with the text, whereas LMMs deal with more modalities including text, image, audio and video. This continuous enhancement of generative AI models is bringing AI chatbots closer to the human working.

Depending on the type of use of AI chatbots, these limitations may or may not impact them significantly. This paper will organise the limitations of AI chatbots into six main categories: intelligence and understanding related limitations; accuracy and credibility related limitations; ethics and regulations related limitations; accountability, transparency and consistency related limitations; design, coding and training related limitations; and human, machine and vender related limitations. The aim of this paper is to emphasise, organise and analyse numerous limitations of AI chatbots into the proposed categories; accordingly, users should become more cognisant about all these limitations in deciding their suitability or unsuitability for the specific use cases.",

  abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to improve static program analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach interleaves calls to the static analyzer and queries to the LLM. The query to the LLM is constructed based on intermediate results from the static analysis, and subsequent static analysis uses the results from the LLM query. We apply our approach to the problem of error-specification inference: given systems code written in C, infer the set of values that each function can return on error. Such error specifications aid in program understanding and can be used to find error-handling bugs. We implemented our approach by incorporating LLMs into EESI, the state-of-the-art static analysis for error-specification inference. Compared to EESI, our approach achieves higher recall (from an average of 52.55% to 77.83%) and higher F1-score (from an average of 0.612 to 0.804) while maintaining precision (from an average of 86.67% to 85.12%) on real-world benchmarks such as Apache HTTPD and MbedTLS. We also conducted experiments to understand the sources of imprecision in our LLM-assisted analysis as well as the impact of LLM nondeterminism on the analysis results.},

As emerging technologies continue to advance, it is imperative to facilitate their proper integration into society, managing expectations and fear. This paper investigates users’ perceptions of generative AI using 3M posts on Twitter from January 2019 to March 2023, especially focusing on their occupation and usage. We find that people across various occupations, not just IT-related ones, show a strong interest in generative AI. The sentiment toward generative AI is generally positive, and remarkably, their sentiments are positively correlated with their exposure to AI. Among occupations, illustrators show exceptionally negative sentiment mainly due to concerns about the unethical usage of artworks in constructing AI. People use ChatGPT in diverse ways, and notably the casual usage in which they “play with” ChatGPT tends to be associated with positive sentiments. These findings would offer valuable lessons for policymaking on the emergence of new technology and also empirical insights for the considerations of future human-AI symbiosis.},

On the other hand, due to inherent characteristics of AI/ML components and design of AI/ML pipeline, AI/ML services can be a target for sophisticated attacks. In order to provide a holistic security view, the effect of AI/ML components should be investigated, threats should be identified, and countermeasures should be planned. Therefore, in this study, which is an extended version of our recent study (Karaçay et al. 2023), we shed the light on the use of AI/ML services including generative large language model scenarios in All-Senses meeting use case and their security aspects by carrying out a threat modeling using the STRIDE framework and attack tree methodology.

  abstract = {Deep Neural Network-based models have demonstrated high accuracy for semantic code clone detection. However, the lack of generalization poses a threat to the trustworthiness and reliability of these models. Furthermore, the black-box nature of these models makes interpreting the model’s decisions very challenging. Currently, there is only a limited understanding of the semantic code clone detection behavior of existing models. There is a lack of transparency in understanding how a model identifies semantic code clones and the exact code components influencing its prediction. In this paper, we introduce the use of a causal interpretation framework based on the Neyman-Rubin causal model to gain insight into the decision-making of four state-of-the-art clone detection models. Using the causal interpretation framework, we derive causal explanations of models’ decisions by performing interventions guided by expert-labeled data. We measure the alignment of models’ decision-making with expert intuition by evaluating the causal effects of code similarities and differences on the clone predictions of the models. Additionally, we evaluate the similarity intuition alignment, robustness to confounding influences, and prediction consistency of the models. Finally, we rank the models in order of most aligned and thus most reliable to least aligned and thus least reliable for semantic code clone detection. Our contributions lay a foundation for building and evaluating trustworthy semantic code clone detection systems.},

The massive adoption of generative LLMs and the capabilities they have shown have prompted public concerns regarding their impact on the labor market, privacy, the use of copyrighted work, and how these models align with human ethics and the rule of law. As a response, new regulations are being pushed, which require developers and service providers to evaluate, monitor, and forestall or at least mitigate the risks posed by their models. One mitigation strategy is digital forgetting: given a model with undesirable knowledge or behavior, the goal is to obtain a new model where the detected issues are no longer present. Digital forgetting is usually enforced via machine unlearning techniques, which modify trained machine learning models for them to behave as models trained on a subset of the original training data. In this work, we describe the motivations and desirable properties of digital forgetting when applied to LLMs, and we survey recent works on machine unlearning. Specifically, we propose a taxonomy of unlearning methods based on the reach and depth of the modifications done on the models, we discuss and compare the effectiveness of machine unlearning methods for LLMs proposed so far, and we survey their evaluation. Finally, we describe open problems of machine unlearning applied to LLMs and we put forward recommendations for developers and practitioners.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in the domain of software vulnerability detection and management, offering sophisticated capabilities in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security risks. This article delves into the utilization of LLMs, examining their role in revolutionizing traditional approaches to software vulnerability detection. We explore the various categories of LLMs, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), and how these models are being leveraged to improve the accuracy and efficiency of vulnerability detection. This article reviews how LLMs are being integrated into existing software security frameworks, synthesizing research findings on their performance in various contexts. It includes insights into how LLM-based methods complement traditional techniques like static analysis and fuzz testing, without engaging in a direct comparative analysis of these approaches. The comparison highlights the strengths of LLMs, such as their ability to generalize across diverse codebases and programming languages, while also addressing their limitations, such as susceptibility to biases from training data and the hallucination. The article synthesizes findings from recent research, showcasing how LLMs have been successfully employed to detect a range of vulnerabilities, from buffer overflows to SQL injections, and outlines how these models enhance productivity by automating the detection and reporting of security flaws. Additionally, we discuss the inherent challenges in applying LLMs to software vulnerability detection, such as the need for high-quality datasets, and the ethical implications related to the deployment of LLM-based systems in security-critical applications. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the future advancement of LLM technologies in the cybersecurity domain. A comprehensive introduction to foundational and specialized datasets is provided, including datasets such as CVEfixes, Big-Vul, and LineVul, which are tailored for software vulnerability detection. These datasets serve as crucial resources for training and benchmarking LLMs. Moreover, we introduce evaluation metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC that are used to assess the performance of models in detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities, offering a structured way to gauge the success and limitations of LLMs. In addition, the article explores fine-tuning techniques such as full fine-tuning, feature extraction, adapter-based fine-tuning, and LoRA (low-rank adaptation), highlighting how each method can enhance LLM performance in vulnerability detection. By focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, such as adapter layers and prefix-tuning, and LoRa, we outline ways to optimize model performance while reducing computational overhead. By providing a comprehensive review of the literature and practical insights into LLM integration, this article aims to fill the gap in existing research and serve as a foundational guide for future investigations. Researchers and practitioners in the field of software security will benefit from the comparative analyses, detailed case studies, and strategic recommendations provided herein, which collectively highlight the potential of LLMs to complement and enhance traditional software vulnerability detection techniques.},

  abstract = {Generative AI models for music and the arts in general are increasingly complex and hard to understand. The field of explainable AI (XAI) seeks to make complex and opaque AI models such as neural networks more understandable to people. One approach to making generative AI models more understandable is to impose a small number of semantically meaningful attributes on generative AI models. This paper contributes a systematic examination of the impact that different combinations of variational auto-encoder models (measureVAE and adversarialVAE), configurations of latent space in the AI model (from 4 to 256 latent dimensions), and training datasets (Irish folk, Turkish folk, classical, and pop) have on music generation performance when 2 or 4 meaningful musical attributes are imposed on the generative model. To date, there have been no systematic comparisons of such models at this level of combinatorial detail. Our findings show that measureVAE has better reconstruction performance than adversarialVAE which has better musical attribute independence. Results demonstrate that measureVAE was able to generate music across music genres with interpretable musical dimensions of control, and performs best with low complexity music such as pop and rock. We recommend that a 32 or 64 latent dimensional space is optimal for 4 regularised dimensions when using measureVAE to generate music across genres. Our results are the first detailed comparisons of configurations of state-of-the-art generative AI models for music and can be used to help select and configure AI models, musical features, and datasets for more understandable generation of music.},

  abstract = {Language identification is a major task in natural language processing. It serves as an initial and effective stage in critical tasks such as information extraction, sentiment analysis, and question answering. Most research on language identification has focused on monolingual contexts, performing poorly with texts containing code-mixing. Identifying the language in social media texts, such as those on Twitter, poses challenges due to high levels of code-mixing. Consequently, creating an accurate language identification tool for code-mixed texts is essential for intelligent systems that rely on natural language processing, such as advanced search engines and question-answering systems. Recently, significant research has been conducted in non-Persian languages in this field. However, no substantial efforts have been made to recognize languages in code-mixed Persian texts. In this paper, we introduce a dataset called PinLID, collected from tweets with Persian-English code-mixing, labeled at both the sentence and token levels using a supervised learning approach to language identification. We evaluated the dataset using various machine learning classification algorithms, including the classical SVM method, the multilingual BERT language model, XLM-RoBERTa, ParsBERT, AriaBERT, and PersianLLaMA: Persian Large Language Model. The testing yielded results as high as 99.59% F1 score at both the sentence and token levels in the test data.},

  abstract = {Using artificial intelligence (AI) in research offers many important benefits for science and society but also creates novel and complex ethical issues. While these ethical issues do not necessitate changing established ethical norms of science, they require the scientific community to develop new guidance for the appropriate use of AI. In this article, we briefly introduce AI and explain how it can be used in research, examine some of the ethical issues raised when using it, and offer nine recommendations for responsible use, including: (1) Researchers are responsible for identifying, describing, reducing, and controlling AI-related biases and random errors; (2) Researchers should disclose, describe, and explain their use of AI in research, including its limitations, in language that can be understood by non-experts; (3) Researchers should engage with impacted communities, populations, and other stakeholders concerning the use of AI in research to obtain their advice and assistance and address their interests and concerns, such as issues related to bias; (4) Researchers who use synthetic data should (a) indicate which parts of the data are synthetic; (b) clearly label the synthetic data; (c) describe how the data were generated; and (d) explain how and why the data were used; (5) AI systems should not be named as authors, inventors, or copyright holders but their contributions to research should be disclosed and described; (6) Education and mentoring in responsible conduct of research should include discussion of ethical use of AI.},

  title = {Beyond principlism: practical strategies for ethical AI use in research practices},
  year = {2024},
  journal = {AI and Ethics},
  abstract = {The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scientific research, particularly large language models (LLMs), has outpaced the development of ethical guidelines, leading to a “Triple-Too” problem: too many high-level ethical initiatives, too abstract principles lacking contextual and practical relevance, and too much focus on restrictions and risks over benefits and utilities. Existing approaches—principlism (reliance on abstract ethical principles), formalism (rigid application of rules), and technological solutionism (overemphasis on technological fixes)—offer little practical guidance for addressing ethical challenges of AI in scientific research practices. To bridge the gap between abstract principles and day-to-day research practices, a user-centered, realism-inspired approach is proposed here. It outlines five specific goals for ethical AI use: (1) understanding model training and output, including bias mitigation strategies; (2) respecting privacy, confidentiality, and copyright; (3) avoiding plagiarism and policy violations; (4) applying AI beneficially compared to alternatives; and (5) using AI transparently and reproducibly. Each goal is accompanied by actionable strategies and realistic cases of misuse and corrective measures. I argue that ethical AI application requires evaluating its utility against existing alternatives rather than isolated performance metrics. Additionally, I propose documentation guidelines to enhance transparency and reproducibility in AI-assisted research. Moving forward, we need targeted professional development, training programs, and balanced enforcement mechanisms to promote responsible AI use while fostering innovation. By refining these ethical guidelines and adapting them to emerging AI capabilities, we can accelerate scientific progress without compromising research integrity.},

abstract="Large language models (LLMs) have evolved rapidly and demonstrated superior performance over the past few months. Training these models is both expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, some companies have begun to offer embedding as a service (EaaS) based on these LLMs to reap the benefits. However, this makes them potentially vulnerable to model extraction attacks which can replicate a functionally similar model and thereby infringe upon copyright. To protect the copyright of LLMs for EaaS, we propose a backdoor watermarking method by injecting a secret cosine signal into embeddings of original text with triggers. The secret signal, generated and authenticated using identity information, establishes a direct link between the watermark and the copyright owner. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness, showing minimal impact on downstream tasks and high detection accuracy, as well as exhibiting resilience to forgery attacks.",

  journal = {AI and Ethics},
  abstract = {The race to develop image generation models is intensifying, with a rapid increase in the number of text-to-image models available. This is coupled with growing public awareness of these technologies. Though other generative AI models—notably, large language models—have received recent critical attention for the social and other non-technical issues they raise, there has been relatively little comparable examination of image generation models. This paper reports on a novel, comprehensive categorization of the social issues associated with image generation models. At the intersection of machine learning and the social sciences, we report the results of a survey of the literature, identifying seven issue clusters arising from image generation models: data issues, intellectual property, bias, privacy, and the impacts on the informational, cultural, and natural environments. We situate these social issues in the model life cycle, to aid in considering where potential issues arise, and mitigation may be needed. We then compare these issue clusters with what has been reported for large language models. Ultimately, we argue that the risks posed by image generation models are comparable in severity to the risks posed by large language models, and that the social impact of image generation models must be urgently considered, even as their development and deployment are pushed forward.},

Using watermarking methods has always been an active research subject against unauthorized users to protect copyrighted data. Deep watermarking methods were introduced in recent years to face this challenge, however, the robustness of these methods against graphic attacks and generating high-quality marked-images are still one of the important challenges in this issue. Also, exposure of these methods to the risk of intellectual property infringement is another important challenge in this subject. To address the quality degradation challenge of marked-images, we propose a blind deep image-watermarking method inspired by the Siamese network in which the watermark-codes will be embedded in the network’s weights instead of cover-images. Also, a cover-atmosphere is defined for each cover-image which includes the cover-image and its various attacked versions. Favorable robustness is achieved by mapping each cover-atmosphere to its corresponding watermark-code space. Moreover, an independent subspace for non-watermark-images is considered to map into a null-code which makes the method robust against intellectual property infringement attack. The results obtained from the experiment show that the suggested approach outperforms existing methods and can withstand different types of graphical and surrogate model attacks.},

The objectives of this article are three-fold: (1) to identify illegal and nonconsensual NSE deepfakes and illegal uses of them; (2) to critically evaluate the current legal and technological countermeasures available in various jurisdictions to combat illicit and nonconsensual NSE deepfakes; and (3) to make recommendations based on challenges and deficits in existing legal and technological mechanisms employed to tackle them.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini has led to a surge in academic misconduct. Students can now complete their assignments and exams just by asking an LLM for solutions to the given problem, without putting in the effort required for learning. And, what is more worrying, educators do not have the proper tools to detect it. The more advanced AI tools become, the more human-like text they generate, and the more difficult they are to detect. Additionally, some educators find it difficult to adapt their teaching and assessment methods to avoid plagiarism. This paper is focused on how LLMs and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) have affected education. It first shows the relationship between LLMs and academic dishonesty. Then, it reviews state-of-the-art solutions for preventing academic plagiarism in detail, including a survey of the main datasets, algorithms, tools, and evasion strategies for plagiarism detection. Lastly, it identifies gaps in existing solutions and presents potential long-term solutions based on AI tools and educational approaches to address plagiarism in an ever-changing world.},

  pages = {39},
  abstract = {Deep generative models have shown the ability to devise both valid and novel chemistry, which could significantly accelerate the identification of bioactive compounds. Many current models, however, use molecular descriptors or ligand-based predictive methods to guide molecule generation towards a desirable property space. This restricts their application to relatively data-rich targets, neglecting those where little data is available to sufficiently train a predictor. Moreover, ligand-based approaches often bias molecule generation towards previously established chemical space, thereby limiting their ability to identify truly novel chemotypes. In this work, we assess the ability of using molecular docking via Glide—a structure-based approach—as a scoring function to guide the deep generative model REINVENT and compare model performance and behaviour to a ligand-based scoring function. Additionally, we modify the previously published MOSES benchmarking dataset to remove any induced bias towards non-protonatable groups. We also propose a new metric to measure dataset diversity, which is less confounded by the distribution of heavy atom count than the commonly used internal diversity metric. With respect to the main findings, we found that when optimizing the docking score against DRD2, the model improves predicted ligand affinity beyond that of known DRD2 active molecules. In addition, generated molecules occupy complementary chemical and physicochemical space compared to the ligand-based approach, and novel physicochemical space compared to known DRD2 active molecules. Furthermore, the structure-based approach learns to generate molecules that satisfy crucial residue interactions, which is information only available when taking protein structure into account. Overall, this work demonstrates the advantage of using molecular docking to guide de novo molecule generation over ligand-based predictors with respect to predicted affinity, novelty, and the ability to identify key interactions between ligand and protein target. Practically, this approach has applications in early hit generation campaigns to enrich a virtual library towards a particular target, and also in novelty-focused projects, where de novo molecule generation either has no prior ligand knowledge available or should not be biased by it.},

  volume = {58},

  journal = {Artificial Intelligence Review},
  pages = {99},
  abstract = {The rapid development of deep learning technology has led to the emergence of diffusion models as a promising generative model with diverse applications. These include image generation, audio and video synthesis, molecular design, and text generation. The distinctive generation mechanism and exceptional generation quality of diffusion models have made them a valuable tool in these diverse fields. However, with the extensive deployment of diffusion models in the domain of image generation, concerns pertaining to data privacy, data security, and artistic ethics have emerged with increasing prominence. Given the accelerated pace of development in the field of diffusion models, the majority of extant surveys are deficient in two respects: firstly, they fail to encompass the latest advances in diffusion-based image synthesis; and secondly, they seldom consider the potential social implications of diffusion models. In order to address these issues, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of the most recent applications of diffusion models in the field of image generation. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth analysis of the potential social impacts that may result from their use. Firstly, this paper presents a systematic survey of the background principles and theoretical foundations of diffusion models. Subsequently, this paper provides a detailed examination of the most recent applications of diffusion models across a range of image generation subfields, including style transfer, image completion, image editing, super-resolution, and beyond. Finally, we present a comprehensive examination of these social issues, addressing data privacy concerns, such as the potential for data leakage and the implementation of protective measures during model training. We also analyse the risk of malicious exploitation of the model and the defensive strategies employed to mitigate such risks. Additionally, we examine the implications of the authenticity and originality of generated images on artistic creativity and copyright protection.},

We propose a model to extract the chemical information from those AFM images in order to achieve a complete identification of the imaged molecule. Our Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) converts a stack of constant-height HR-AFM images at various tip-sample distances into a ball-and-stick depiction, where balls of different color and size represent the chemical species and sticks represent the bonds, providing complete information on the structure and chemical composition. The CGAN has been trained and tested with the QUAM-AFM data set, that contains simulated AFM images for a collection of 686000 organic molecules that include all the chemical species relevant in organic chemistry. Tests with a large set of theoretical images and few experimental examples demonstrate the accuracy and potential of our approach for molecular identification.},

In this chapter, we undertake a comparative study that offers insight into whether the convergence of law applies to legal issues of global relevance in a digital environment. Furthermore, this chapter studies the most recent court decisions concerning property and intellectual property issues. We conclude that there has been an increasing level of convergence of law towards a harmonised concept of digital assets in a world built on blockchain and tokens. The legal systems have advanced closer towards a concept of property with many shared features. NFTed artworks are considered incorporeal assets that confer quasi-property rights and interests.

  abstract = {High-quality diverse image datasets, particularly those featuring faces and medical records, are essential for deep learning applications in computer vision. Protecting the copyright and privacy of such datasets remains a challenge, as existing blind watermarking methods fall short of effectively monitoring and restricting unauthorized access. To address this issue, we propose ImageShield, a responsibility-to-person blind watermarking mechanism for image datasets protection. It introduces a hybrid approach, combining traditional transform domain watermarking with an enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN), achieving an optimal balance between watermark imperceptibility and robustness. In the extraction phase, an optimized network architecture integrates the enhanced GAN with a specially designed attack layer, improving the efficiency of watermark feature retrieval, and reducing computational overhead. The method ensures high fidelity in extracting watermark features, even under potential distortions or attacks, by leveraging the robust structure of the GAN and attack layer. Experimental results on the Helen datasets and custom datasets demonstrate ImageShield’s superiority in terms of imperceptibility (PSNR: 37.2963 dB, SSIM: 0.9906), robustness, watermark embedding capacity, and execution efficiency. These contributions offer a novel solution to enhance the security and traceability of protected image datasets.},

To begin tackling these issues and identifying a role for AI in the production and protection of human artwork, it is necessary to take a multidisciplinary approach which considers current legal precedents, the practice of software engineering, historical attitudes towards technological innovation and a sustained technical analysis of the models themselves. This paper queries the location and nature of substantive artistic work in the developmental stages of an AI-generated image, offering critiques of existing assumptions and posing questions for future research. The emergence of convincing AI creative output, artistic or literary, has significant long-term implications for the humanities, including the need for re-appraisal of foundational ideas about authorship and creativity in general.

While Twitter users generally expressed a positive attitude toward using ChatGPT, their concerns converged into five categories: academic integrity, impact on learning outcomes and skill development, limitation of capabilities, policy and social concerns, and workforce challenges. We also found that users from the tech, education, and media fields were often implicated in the conversation, while education and tech individual users led the discussion of concerns. Based on these findings, the study provides several implications for policymakers, tech companies and individuals, educators, and media agencies.

Then, we consider if and how the Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques, which have been widely developed for traditional software and deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks as independent processes to check the alignment of their implementations against the specifications, can be integrated and further extended throughout the lifecycle of the LLMs to provide rigorous analysis to the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs and their applications. Specifically, we consider four complementary techniques: falsification and evaluation, verification, runtime monitoring, and regulations and ethical use. In total, 370+ references are considered to support the quick understanding of the safety and trustworthiness issues from the perspective of V&V. While intensive research has been conducted to identify the safety and trustworthiness issues, rigorous yet practical methods are called for to ensure the alignment of LLMs with safety and trustworthiness requirements.},

abstract="The ongoing advancement of technology has initiated a race to use artificial intelligence in every domain of knowledge, including our personal spaces. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a generic term used for many applications in different levels of intervention on humanity mainly referred to by its acronym ``AI''. One of the applications of AI has mastered to personalise us in the digital world. Deepfakes refer to one of these manifestations to deceive humans with the aid of AI, wherein machine learning algorithms, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), are employed to produce synthetic media that bears resemblance to human beings, albeit with some elements of the content being altered. In contemporary times, the task of differentiating authentic information generated by human agents from that produced by Deepfakes algorithms has become increasingly arduous. Deepfakes are socially disturbing and so manipulative to the human brain because of their ability to create a public deception with regrettable results. Hence, both society and nations must possess systems capable of autonomously detecting and assessing material without human intervention. Regrettably, AI has yet to be acknowledged as an independent legal discipline. In this scenario, can per se AI be held responsible for its act especially when AI is not recognised as a legal entity? The objective of this study is to ascertain the regulatory framework governing AI as perpetrators of Deepfakes crimes and to establish the criminal liability of AI entities involved in criminal activities within India. Furthermore, it elucidates the potential significance of Deepfakes in the realm of criminal justice administration. The paper will additionally examine whether the gaps in the current legislation to address these concerns. The paper will culminate in providing recommendations for criminal justice administration of AI in India.",

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems will increasingly be used to cause harm as they grow more capable. In fact, AI systems are already starting to help automate fraudulent activities, violate human rights, create harmful fake images, and identify dangerous toxins. To prevent some misuses of AI, we argue that targeted interventions on certain capabilities will be warranted. These restrictions may include controlling who can access certain types of AI models, what they can be used for, whether outputs are filtered or can be traced back to their user, and the resources needed to develop them. We also contend that new restrictions on non-AI capabilities needed to cause harm will be required. For example, concerns about AI-enabled bioweapon acquisition have motivated efforts to introduce DNA synthesis screening. Though capability restrictions risk reducing use more than misuse (resulting in an unfavorable Misuse–Use Tradeoff), we argue that interventions on capabilities are warranted in some circumstances when other interventions are insufficient, the potential harm from misuse is high, and there are targeted interventions. We provide a taxonomy of interventions that can reduce AI misuse, focusing on the specific steps required for a misuse to cause harm (the Misuse Chain), and a framework to determine if an intervention is warranted. We exemplify our framework to three examples: predicting novel toxins, creating harmful images, and automating spear phishing campaigns.},

  title = {Decent deepfakes? Professional deepfake developers’ ethical considerations and their governance potential},
  year = {2024},
  journal = {AI and Ethics},
  abstract = {Policymakers and societies are grappling with the question of how to respond to deepfakes, i.e., synthetic audio-visual media which is proliferating in all areas of digital life– from politics to pornography. However, debates and research on deepfakes’ impact and governance largely neglect the technology’s sources, namely the developers of the underlying artificial intelligence (AI), and those who provide code or deepfake creation services to others, making the technology widely accessible. These actors include open-source developers, professionals working in large technology companies and specialized start-ups, and for deepfake apps. They can profoundly impact which underlying AI technologies are developed, whether and how they are made public, and what kind of deepfakes can be created. Therefore, this paper explores which values guide professional deepfake development, how economic and academic pressures and incentives influence developers’ (perception of) agency and ethical views, and how these views do and could impact deepfake design, creation, and dissemination. Thereby, the paper focuses on values derived from debates on AI ethics and on deepfakes’ impact. It is based on ten qualitative in-depth expert interviews with academic and commercial deepfake developers and ethics representatives of synthetic media companies. The paper contributes to a more nuanced understanding of AI ethics in relation to audio-visual generative AI. Besides, it empirically informs and enriches the deepfake governance debate by incorporating developers’ voices and highlighting governance measures which directly address deepfake developers and providers and emphasize the potential of ethics to curb the dangers of deepfakes.},

We introduce the principles and methodologies of these algorithms, outlining their strengths and limitations through experimental comparisons. End-to-end construction algorithms employ neural networks to generate solutions from scratch, demonstrating rapid solving speed but often yielding subpar solutions. Conversely, end-to-end improvement algorithms iteratively refine initial solutions, achieving higher-quality outcomes but necessitating longer computation times. Direct hybrid algorithms directly integrate deep learning with heuristic algorithms, showcasing robust solving performance and generalization capability. LLM-based hybrid algorithms leverage LLMs to autonomously generate and refine heuristics, showing promising performance despite being in early developmental stages. In the future, further integration of deep learning techniques, particularly LLMs, with heuristic algorithms and advancements in interpretability and generalization will be pivotal trends in TSP algorithm design. These endeavors aim to tackle larger and more complex real-world instances while enhancing algorithm reliability and practicality. This paper offers insights into the evolving landscape of DL-based TSP solving algorithms and provides a perspective for future research directions.},

Educators are actively exploring and establishing ethical guidelines for AIED, but the fragmented nature of existing research makes it challenging to develop a comprehensive ethical framework. Through a technical analysis of the AI development process, we found significant similarities between AI development and human education. Therefore, this study uses this analogy to help educators better understand AI principles and identify key areas where AIED may lack ethical standards. Consequently, we propose a five-step, multi-layered ethical framework for AIED to guide the specific deployment and implementation of ethical guidelines, and provide a set of ethical review processes for educational policymakers to regulate and review AIED applications.},

The use of ChatGPT and other generative AI needs to be set in the context of a longer-term process of the digitisation of writing, where many tools are being employed by students to support writing because it is a complex iterative process. Generative AI appears to have had a large impact on how students write, and we propose a model of generative AI literacy to assess their capabilities in doing so. Semi-structured interviews and observation data were collected at a British University with 23 students from diverse backgrounds, including the UK, USA, China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. The data was analysed thematically. It was found that students used ChatGPT alongside many other tools, and in rather individualistic ways often to address specific challenges they felt they had with writing. Their main concerns were around plagiarism, information inaccuracy and technology dependence. There was a relatively weak understanding or interest in the ethical issues around the exploitative and environmental impacts of generative AI. The social controversy around ChatGPT can be seen as a useful opportunity to engage students in a discussion about the digitisation of writing and promote AI literacy in this context.},

abstract="The Internet lies now amidst a new cycle of disruption due to the mass adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). As a research field, AI even predates the Internet; however, the technology just reached the necessary maturity and availability of resources and capital. In fact, AI does not think. It just extracts correlations from large amounts of data and training material and then uses them to make predictions or generate new content. The result statistically imitates the production of a human brain but is inherently bound to contain mistakes. It also replicates societal biases, and it is arguable whether its output constitutes original creation. Indeed, AI will bring forth societal and economic changes. It could thus further erode the digital sovereignty of countries that rely on foreign AI providers and fragment the Internet into ecosystems shaped by competing AI models. Europe has tried to address these risks via regulation (AI Act); adopting the open-source paradigm could also help. In the end, AI could even fragment reality, enticing us into virtual relationships with simulated humans. We must build our ability to use AIs as tools rather than depend on them.",

Specifically with image theft, there lies the issue of getting permission to use images in a deep learning model. Therefore, we propose a threefold contribution. First, we offer a tool to provide image owners with the capabilities to mark their images with a specific watermark that states that they do not wish their images to be used for training imaging models. To this end, we propose two different simple watermark algorithms. The second contribution is a deep learning model to identify the existence of a watermark in an image. The accuracy result was 97.3{\%} for the classification of images marked with the rolling average watermark algorithm. However, the ring circle algorithm was overfitted. Our third contribution is an open solution that can be replicated or extended by practitioners.",

This chapter investigates the viability of employing LLMs to bridge the existing deficiencies in SoC security, aiming to develop a verification strategy that is fortified, more scalable, and adaptable. This integration of LLMs into the SoC security verification process marks the dawn of an innovative era, fraught with both opportunities and challenges, in safeguarding complex SoC systems.

This paper offers a qualitative analysis of the perspectives of AI engineers on the importance of curiosity in their profession. The results of this study—which took place at a technology multinational of over 250 k + employees—warn that unless curiosity is carefully defined, detached from masculinized interpretations of what it entails, and linked to ethical development practices, the current emphasis on curiosity risks promoting harmful curiosity-based engineering practices. The paper begins by exposing the consequences of curiosity’s configuration within existing corporate and social inequalities. It then reviews theoretical literature on the gendering of skills and attributes in AI engineering. Having synthesized evidence of curiosity’s importance in corporate AI engineering, it draws on new qualitative data to draw out key themes that might be contributing to the gendering of curiosity, before exploring these themes in their wider context through the theoretical literature. It ends by outlining ways that curiosity-based engineering could promote rather than hinder ethical AI.},

These threats, perpetrated by insiders, may arise from delinquency, retaliation, or motives such as ambition for success, recognition, financial gain, or knowledge acquisition. They manifest in various forms; for example, an insider might disrupt systems by inserting a malicious script or engage in intellectual property theft. Due to their diverse nature, detection is highly complex and challenging, as standard security devices such as intrusion detection systems, firewalls, or antivirus software cannot detect it; hence, it entails careful and diligent work. This survey reviews existing research between 2010 and 2024 on detecting insider threats. It not only expounds on the novel taxonomy based on previous works and diverse motivations for insider threats but also identifies challenges and gaps in detecting malicious insiders. It highlights the state-of-the-art tools, techniques, and methodologies and also discusses the limitations of the same. Finally, the paper provides an overview of identifying optimal solutions and discusses future research directions that could lead to new methods for detecting insider threats.},

abstract="Diving deeper, this chapter looks into the mutual influence of humans and AI. Grounded in the multidimensional framework introduced in Chapter 1, and the A-Frame that applies it in the context of human Agency Amid AI, we will examine human consciousness and artificial consciousness. From here we look at inferred intelligence, and the potential of tandems that leverage the complementarity of natural and artificial perception. The technological transition that humanity is traversing from one industrial revolution to the next is examined, with the proposition to expand the traditional triple bottom line to include purpose; the Quadruple bottom line recognizes the responsibility of the private sector towards the Common Good. This sets the stage to explore the place of human trust and artificial integrity, and the type of regulation needed to establish guardrails that grow with the challenge of an evolving subject. Data is looked at as the central bottleneck of an inclusive society, as biased inputs result in biased outcomes, and the amplification of exclusion in a hybrid society. Ironically the stronger the technology in our life grows, the weaker our cognitive defense mechanisms become, and the more at risk we are to fall prey to the all pervasive nature of artificial persuasion. Unless we are aware of the causes and consequences of our own perception, the potential of artificial influence, combined with the temptation of delegating mental effort to artificial assistance jeopardizes our autonomy, and the formation of free will. An exit from this dangerous dynamic starts by identifying what we want, and why; to clarify who we are and what we stand for. The alignment of humans and technology starts with personal and interpersonal harmonization. That alignment of individual aspirations and actions is the precursor of algorithms that are aligned with aspirations. This dynamic cannot be reverse engineered. The hybrid alignment conundrum cannot be solved online.",

  abstract = {In the past decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved unprecedented success, where statistical models become the central entity in AI. However, the centralized training and inference paradigm for building and using these models is facing more and more privacy and legal challenges. To bridge the gap between data privacy and the need for data fusion, an emerging AI paradigm federated learning (FL) has emerged as an approach for solving data silos and data privacy problems. Based on secure distributed AI, federated learning emphasizes data security throughout the lifecycle, which includes the following steps: data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployments. FL keeps data security by using methods, such as secure multi-party computation (MPC), differential privacy, and hardware solutions, to build and use distributed multiple-party machine-learning systems and statistical models over different data sources. Besides data privacy concerns, we argue that the concept of “model” matters, when developing and deploying federated models, they are easy to expose to various kinds of risks including plagiarism, illegal copy, and misuse. To address these issues, we introduce FedIPR, a novel ownership verification scheme, by embedding watermarks into FL models to verify the ownership of FL models and protect model intellectual property rights (IPR or IP-right for short). While security is at the core of FL, there are still many articles referred to distributed machine learning with no security guarantee as “federated learning”, which are not satisfied with the FL definition supposed to be. To this end, in this paper, we reiterate the concept of federated learning and propose secure federated learning (SFL), where the ultimate goal is to build trustworthy and safe AI with strong privacy-preserving and IP-right-preserving. We provide a comprehensive overview of existing works, including threats, attacks, and defenses in each phase of SFL from the lifecycle perspective.},

abstract="This chapter presents a new political theory of affect, focusing on the politics of cooperation and collaboration developed in the relational ontology and that of becoming and creation emphasized in the discussion of the virtuality of affect. It analyzes the confrontation between copyright regime and the free software movement surrounding algorithms through this new concept of affective politics. Specifically, this chapter explores the main areas of the free software movement, including ``GNU GPL,'' ``DRM,'' ``HTML 5,'' ``Back Door,'' ``Secure Boot,'' and ``JavaScript,'' from the perspective of molecular traversals. In so doing, it sheds light on how the affective politics of free algorithms advances biopolitics from below that challenges the biopower of copyright and proprietary software. In addition, this chapter examines how the molecular movement of free software, which resists the copyright and proprietary algorithm's non-conscious and pre-linguistic coordination of basic computing and networking environment, disrupts and transgresses the molar fault of proprietary algorithms, actualizing the potential for minority politics of becoming.",

Because they can independently create original content, LLMs are often seen as creative agents. Contrary to the belief that LLMs are creative, this paper argues that LLMs are not creative for two reasons. First, LLMs are not creative because they lack an essential component of creativity, which is the first-person experience of the world. Secondly, LLMs are not creative because they are not the principal authors of their creative output, for they lack the subjective awareness and intentionality necessary to be regarded as authors, and their output is a collaborative effort of the AI model, data providers, and other stakeholders. Since they are not full-fledged authors in a traditional sense, they are not creative.},

The difficulty of obtaining multimodal MRIs makes it effective to synthesize medical images of missing modalities from existing one. To train a one-for-all synthesizer with limited number of unpaired MRIs, a novel cross-dimensional knowledge-guided generative adversarial network (CKG–GAN) is proposed. In CKG–GAN, a cross-dimensional knowledge transfer network is utilized to measure the perceptual similarity of 2D images (slices of MRIs) from source and synthesized modalities, the knowledge of which is transferred from a pre-trained 3D network without accessing its private training data set. We evaluate the proposed model for three tasks on BraTs2018 and BraTs2021 data sets, using one modality of T1, T2 or Flair to synthesize the other two modalities without changing the content. The results show that compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the performance by 2–7%.},

abstract="Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate high-quality images from textual prompts. However, increasing research indicates that these models memorize and replicate images from their training data, raising concerns about potential copyright infringement and privacy risks. In our study, we provide a novel perspective to understand this memorization phenomenon by examining its relationship with cross-attention mechanisms. We reveal that during memorization, the cross-attention tends to focus disproportionately on the embeddings of specific tokens. The diffusion model is overfitted to these token embeddings, memorizing corresponding training images. To elucidate this phenomenon, we further identify and discuss various intrinsic findings of cross-attention that contribute to memorization. Building on these insights, we introduce an innovative approach to detect and mitigate memorization in diffusion models. The advantage of our proposed method is that it will not compromise the speed of either the training or the inference processes in these models while preserving the quality of generation.

Smart contracts enable users to manage significant asset amounts of finances on the blockchain without the involvement of any intermediaries. The conditions and checks that have been written in smart contract and executed to the application cannot be changed again. However, these unique features pose some other risks to the smart contract. Smart contracts have several flaws in its programmable language and methods of execution, despite being a developing technology. To build smart contracts and implement numerous complicated business logics, high-level languages are used by the developers to code smart contracts. Thus, blockchain smart contract is the most important element of any decentralized application, posing the risk for it to be attacked. So, the presence of vulnerabilities are to be taken care of on a priority basis. It is important for detection of vulnerabilities in a smart contract and only then implement and connect it with applications to ensure security of funds. The motive of the paper is to discuss how deep learning may be utilized to deliver bug-free secure smart contracts. Objective of the paper is to detect three kinds of vulnerabilities- reentrancy, timestamp and infinite loop. A deep learning model has been created for detection of smart contract vulnerabilities using graph neural networks. The performance of this model has been compared to the present automated tools and other independent methods. It has been shown that this model has greater accuracy than other methods while comparing the prediction of smart contract vulnerabilities in existing models.},

In this work, we describe a simple procedure to conduct constrained molecule generation with a SMILES-based generative model to extend applicability to scaffold decoration and fragment linking by providing SMILES prompts, without the need for re-training. In combination with reinforcement learning, we show that pre-trained, decoder-only models adapt to these applications quickly and can further optimize molecule generation towards a specified objective. We compare the performance of this approach to a variety of orthogonal approaches and show that performance is comparable or better. For convenience, we provide an easy-to-use python package to facilitate model sampling which can be found on GitHub and the Python Package Index.},

abstract="Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to generate significant benefits, but their blanket application in Africa could exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. This is due to a number of factors, including limited technological advancement, historical injustice and marginalization, and underrepresentation of African languages, values, and norms in training data. Despite comprising nearly one-third of the world's languages, most African languages are underrepresented on the internet: they are primarily oral with little available in written and digitized form. Additionally, most African languages have conflicting orthographic standards. While Africa is undergoing a digital transformation, both internet connectivity and digital literacy remain relatively low and unevenly distributed. This lack of online representation for African languages limits the availability of natural language data for training inclusive language models. This paper examines the potential harms of LLMs in Africa, covering harms already documented for the African context; harms studied and documented for the Western context, but previously unapplied to Africa; and novel potential harms based on the norms, values, practices, and contextual factors of the African continent. This work aims to contribute to a better understanding of potential harms of LLMs in Africa, which in turn could inform and support the development of more inclusive LLMs.",

  abstract = {We present a novel framework for the multi-domain synthesis of artworks from semantic layouts. One of the main limitations of this challenging task is the lack of publicly available segmentation datasets for art synthesis. To address this problem, we propose a dataset called ArtSem that contains 40,000 images of artwork from four different domains, with their corresponding semantic label maps. We first extracted semantic maps from landscape photography and used a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for generating high-quality artwork from semantic maps without requiring paired training data. Furthermore, we propose an artwork-synthesis model using domain-dependent variational encoders for high-quality multi-domain synthesis. Subsequently, the model was improved and complemented with a simple but effective normalization method based on jointly normalizing semantics and style, which we call spatially style-adaptive normalization (SSTAN). Compared to the previous methods, which only take semantic layout as the input, our model jointly learns style and semantic information representation, improving the generation quality of artistic images. These results indicate that our model learned to separate the domains in the latent space. Thus, we can perform fine-grained control of the synthesized artwork by identifying hyperplanes that separate the different domains. Moreover, by combining the proposed dataset and approach, we generated user-controllable artworks of higher quality than that of existing approaches, as corroborated by quantitative metrics and a user study.},

  pages = {29-41},
  abstract = {This paper considers recent experiments in art and artificial intelligence that crystallize around training algorithms to generate artworks based on datasets derived from the Western art historical canon. Over the last decade, a shift towards the rejection of canonicity has begun to take shape in art historical discourse. At the same time, algorithmically enabled practices in the US and Europe have emerged that entrench the Western canon as a locus and guarantor of aesthetic value. Operating within the epistemic framework of a “view from nowhere,” this tendency in generative art inherits the coloniality of both art history and artificial intelligence. Producing “art histories from nowhere,” this tendency conflates the conceptual category of visual art with the histories of Western cultural production. It reproduces a set of aesthetic values that entrench the mythology of the artist-genius and his imputed whiteness and masculinity; the extolment of innovation and novelty as self-evident virtues; disembodied Cartesian models of knowing and sensing; and the erasure of contributions that have been occluded from canonical visibility. As we encounter systems trained on particular visions of art history and of the artist, how might we remain attentive to the specific lens through which they are taught to see? This essay addresses that question by bringing the coloniality of recent experiments into view, bridging data feminisms and decolonial studies to formulate alternative visions of encounters between art and AI.},

  abstract = {Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have played an important role in many fields, while GNNs also suffer from adversarial attacks that aim to malfunction the GNN model by changing the adjacency matrix (i.e. generating adversarial edges) or node features (i.e. generating adversarial features) in graph data. Although the gradient-based adversarial attack methods have achieved remarkable results in DNNs, optimizing discrete adversarial edges in graph data using continuous gradients may lead to sub-optimal solutions. In order to alleviate this situation, we propose a novel Searching and Pairing Attack (SPA) method to effectively generate adversarial edges by treating each adversarial edge as a combination of a pair of adversarial nodes. The proposed SPA method generates the adversarial edges through a Node Searching step and a Node Pairing step. The proposed Node Searching Ant Colony Optimization (NS-ACO) improves the attack effect by using the ability of heuristic algorithm to quickly find the approximate optimal solution, while in the Node Pairing (NP) step we propose a generative graph convolutional network with a novel Aggregate Cooperative (AC) layer to generate a set of nodes that meet the constraints, so as to obtain the perturbation set together with the Node Searching step. The proposed SPA method outperforms the state-of-the-art adversarial attack methods and achieves a misclassification rate of 32.5% in the poisoning attack on Cora dataset with a perturbation rate of 0.5%.},

An overview of different AM techniques is given, along with the importance of design for manufacturing and assembly in progressing AM. The potential of AM to build complicated geometries with great precision has attracted a lot of interest in recent years. TO, one of the major enabling technologies in AM, has been essential in building compliant systems with improved performance across numerous industries. The development of hybrid mechanisms that integrate both compliant and stiff pieces because of improvements in “TO” algorithms has improved their usefulness and efficiency. Augmented realty and digital twins (DTs) have been used with “TO” to improve product design visualization and collaboration. Synergies between IN 4.0, TO, and AM have been discussed along with their cross-domain relevance. Machine learning involvement for more robust integration of IN 4.0 with TO and AM have also been discussed. The development of the Digital Triad, which combines DTs, digital threads, and digital trust to enable effective and secure data sharing and cooperation, is the result of the convergence of internet-of-things, cloud computing, and big data analytics. However, concerns about data privacy and cybersecurity still need to be resolved. The use of machine learning algorithms for cyberattack detection and mitigation as well as secure block chain-based frameworks for managing intellectual property rights are just a few of the frameworks and tactics that researchers have suggested to lower cybersecurity risks in AM systems. The establishment of new standards and guidelines for the cybersecurity of AM systems is anticipated to result from ongoing research in this area.},

Inspired by the ethics of slowness, slow data centers accountability, the human-in-the-loop, local co-design, and vision making for the future city.

We then perform out-of-distribution reconstruction and inference, with feature space standardisation to align the latent distribution of the diverse abnormal samples with the statistics of the healthy samples. We generate per-pixel anomaly scores for each image by calculating the difference between the input and reconstructed images and use this signal for out-of-distribution (i.e., polyp) segmentation.

abstract="Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often inadvertently generate unwanted concepts such as watermarks and unsafe images. These concepts, termed ``implicit concepts'', can be unintentionally learned during training and then be generated uncontrollably during inference. Existing removal methods still struggle to eliminate implicit concepts primarily due to their dependency on the model's ability to recognize concepts it actually can not discern. To address this, we utilize the intrinsic geometric characteristics of implicit concepts and present Geom-Erasing, a novel concept removal method based on geometric-driven control. Specifically, once an unwanted implicit concept is identified, we integrate the existence and geometric information of the concept into the text prompts with the help of an accessible classifier or detector model. Subsequently, the model is optimized to identify and disentangle this information, which is then adopted as negative prompts during generation. Moreover, we introduce the Implicit Concept Dataset (ICD), a novel image-text dataset imbued with three typical implicit concepts (QR codes, watermarks, and text), reflecting real-life situations where implicit concepts are easily injected. Geom-Erasing effectively mitigates the generation of implicit concepts, achieving state-of-the-art results on the Inappropriate Image Prompts (I2P) and our challenging Implicit Concept Dataset (ICD) benchmarks.",

  abstract = {With the development of informatization in recent years, the emergence of QR codes has opened up new paths in mobile payments. Some previous works have attempted to hide information in color images, called image codes, to solve the problem of QR codes not having visual semantics. However, the existing schemes have a low rate of correct information extraction in the face of screen shooting, especially under the interference of strong moiré effects. Therefore, the vision of this paper is to propose an image code method that can resist the moiré effect to improve the practicality of image codes in real-world scenarios. This work introduces a novel model called Screen-Shooting Robust Hyperlink (SSRH) designed to embed hyperlink information into natural color images, and the encoded images are invisible to the human eyes. At the same time, a screen-shooting distortion submodel is constructed between the encoder and decoder, which makes the SSRH model more robust against screen-shooting distortion in the physical environment. The SSRH separates screen-shooting noise simulation training from adversarial network training as a submodel, independent of the adversarial training, and utilizes Bayer CFA (Color Filter Array) to improve the generation of the moiré pattern. The experimental results provide compelling evidence that our proposed SSRH model surpasses state-of-the-art methods regarding its resilience against screen-shooting distortions, particularly those incorporating moiré distortion. The test code of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/Dawn-Hsiao/SSRH.},

Some of the debates are ongoing, with several people getting more used to this tool and some losing touch with several ethical concerns. Thus, it is crucial to explore the early professional’s perspectives surrounding ChatGPT to comprehend its potential impact on the educational sector and, in particular, society in general. This research aims to address this knowledge gap by employing data mining techniques on LinkedIn to analyze ChatGPT-related discussions and provide a comprehensive textual examination. The dataset for this investigation consists of 166 records written in English by LinkedIn users discussing ChatGPT in its early stage. The study utilized VOSviewer software to clean, analyze, mine, and visualize the data. Among the sample, it was observed that 49% of the users are PhD holders, predominantly with experience in scientific research and data science fields. Hence, the findings reveal that issues such as plagiarism, references, citations, manuscripts, papers, and literature reviews stand out as the major concerns. These results suggest that while ChatGPT can contribute to academic progress by fostering new knowledge, thoughts, and ideas, it can also facilitate academic misconduct, including plagiarism and inaccurate information dissemination. Therefore, this paper also provides discussions on the implications and ethical issues of ChatGPT. In particular, it is imperative to establish clear ethical boundaries and guidelines for the appropriate use of LLMs in academic settings.},

  abstract = {Governance theory in political science and international relations has to adapt to the onset of an increasingly digital society. However, until now, technological advancements and the increasing convergence of technologies outpace regulatory efforts and frustrate any efforts to apply ethical and legal frameworks to these domains. This is due to the convergence of multiple, sometimes incompatible governance frameworks that accompany the integration of technologies on different platforms. This theoretical claim will be illustrated by examples such as the integration of technologies on the “human platform” as it is referred to in the case of enhanced soldiers. Hence, successful governance might require new approaches borrowed from a distant relative, namely cybernetics. Insights gained from cybernetics for governance theories might be able to give guidance for a more efficient and adaptive governance approach that is able to deal with increasing complexity caused by technology and governance convergence. While cybernetics itself might be considered a governance approach, it has had surprisingly little reception in the wider field of governance within the area of social and political sciences. This article will develop cybernetic governance as a set of expandable governance principles that are applicable to an increasingly complex digital and smart society. It thereby tries to further galvanise what could be termed cybernetic governance theory as a subject of worthwhile insights from the combination of otherwise largely the disjoined fields of cybernetics and governance.},

We aim to inform such supports by analysing the patterns in the most frequent feedback made by HREC members during review processes. We collected every instance (N = 4,195) of feedback made on N = 197 ‘low-risk’ protocols by all HREC staff (N = 16) at one institution over the course of a full year (2019). Reflexive thematic analysis to identify themes (and content analysis to determine relative frequency) revealed that the top three themes are consistent with existing literature: Consent, Administrative, and Methodological concerns. However, we identified important new themes that are not captured in previous research, including ‘Risk to Researchers’, ‘Commercial benefit, scope and scale’, ‘Diversity’ (covering issues of cultural sensitivity, language and accessibility), as well as fair right to a complaints process. Our thorough exploration of information-rich primary data marks an important methodological improvement over previous studies and offers a theoretical contribution to understanding themes that have heretofore been overlooked in the ethics review process. By identifying the common challenges experienced in HREC review we can better inform tailored supports to applicants (by extension reducing workload burdens on HREC systems) and reduce their perceived barriers to engaging in challenging but meaningful research.},

abstract="The trustworthy machine learning (ML) community is increasingly recognizing the crucial need for models capable of selectively `unlearning' data points after training. This leads to the problem of machine unlearning (MU), aiming to eliminate the influence of chosen data points on model performance, while still maintaining the model's utility post-unlearning. Despite various MU methods for data influence erasure, evaluations have largely focused on random data forgetting, ignoring the vital inquiry into which subset should be chosen to truly gauge the authenticity of unlearning performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new evaluative angle for MU from an adversarial viewpoint. We propose identifying the data subset that presents the most significant challenge for influence erasure, i.e., pinpointing the worst-case forget set. Utilizing a bi-level optimization principle, we amplify unlearning challenges at the upper optimization level to emulate worst-case scenarios, while simultaneously engaging in standard training and unlearning at the lower level, achieving a balance between data influence erasure and model utility. Our proposal offers a worst-case evaluation of MU's resilience and effectiveness. Through extensive experiments across different datasets (including CIFAR-10, 100, CelebA, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet) and models (including both image classifiers and generative models), we expose critical pros and cons in existing (approximate) unlearning strategies. Our results illuminate the complex challenges of MU in practice, guiding the future development of more accurate and robust unlearning algorithms.

The fundamental prediction task of filling in missing values of a label column based on the rest of the columns is essential for various applications as diverse as biomedical risk models, drug discovery and materials science. Although deep learning has revolutionized learning from raw data and led to numerous high-profile success stories3–5, gradient-boosted decision trees6–9 have dominated tabular data for the past 20 years. Here we present the Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previous methods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantially less training time. In 2.8 s, TabPFN outperforms an ensemble of the strongest baselines tuned for 4 h in a classification setting. As a generative transformer-based foundation model, this model also allows fine-tuning, data generation, density estimation and learning reusable embeddings. TabPFN is a learning algorithm that is itself learned across millions of synthetic datasets, demonstrating the power of this approach for algorithm development. By improving modelling abilities across diverse fields, TabPFN has the potential to accelerate scientific discovery and enhance important decision-making in various domains.},

  abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of digital technologies in the twenty-first century has led to calls for education reform focused on digital literacy, but what exactly does this term mean? The concept of digital literacy has evolved much since its evolution from media and new literacies scholarship, resulting in a myriad of definitions. Previous attempts to synthesize these definitions have been productive but limited in scope, population, and focus. In this article, we conducted a broad, systematic review resulting in a corpus of 285 articles published from 2018 to 2023, which we cataloged, coded, thematized, and critiqued. We used these findings to derive a synthesized definition of digital literacy that can inform future education policy and instruction, noting a need for further research on how to better account for the contextual nature of digital literacy skills and applications, differences across individuals’ development, and the growing influence of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {The 3D imaging-based model reconstruction technology is being applied in various aspects of fruit planting management, picking, transportation, and promoting fruit industry automation development. The fruit model based on 3D imaging technology is closer to the external characteristics of the fruit itself. More accurate data is obtained when the model is imported into a computer for simulation and analysis for growth prediction, quality grading, and mechanical damage. The reconstructed fruit models can also be used to calibrate the parameters of the robot’s vision system, optimize the grasping strategy of the picking machinery, and improve the identification sorting and picking accuracy. Some articles have been published on the principles of 3D imaging technology, and there are also numerous studies on the practical application of fruit models. However, no review article exists on applying 3D reconstruction and modeling of fruits using 3D imaging techniques. This paper will focus on the acquiring and processing of 3D data and analyzing the application of imaging principles and technologies such as triangulation, time-of-flight(TOF), interferometry, electromagnetic radiation(EMR), and ultrasound imaging(US). Also, this paper summarizes the application of fruit models for quality assessment, mechanical property study, and picking machinery. Finally, the latest progress in the application of fruit models is prospected.},

Electronic components and devices are produced and distributed across the world, with different regions and countries specializing in different aspects of the supply chain. This global nature of the electronic supply chain industry also poses challenges, particularly in terms of quality control and supply chain transparency involving counterfeit components owing to its interconnected nature. Counterfeiting of integrated circuits (ICs) and semiconductor devices is a significant challenge that poses threats to the safety and reliability of electronic devices, the global economy, intellectual property rights, and the overall sustainability of the electronic supply chain industry. To address this challenge, we propose a novel autoencoding architecture for counterfeit IC detection using a labeled database.

In response, the United States, the European Union, and China have taken the application scenario, life cycle, and responsible subjects of deepfake as the regulatory focus point, thus forming three different regulatory paradigms. The United States adopts an application-based regulatory paradigm, primarily focusing on the use of deepfakes in elections and pornography. The European Union regulates deepfake at different phases through multiple laws and regulations, presenting a life cycle-based regulatory paradigm. China takes the service provider of deepfakes as the subject of regulation and requires it to bear a series of responsibilities, forming a subject-based regulatory paradigm. While these three paradigms deter and mitigate illegal deepfake activities to some extent, they have inherent limitations. From the perspective of the digital ecosystem, current regulation only focuses on content producers, service providers, and distribution platforms but overlooks the significant role of the deepfake audience. By improving the information literacy of the audience, it is possible to enable the audience to effectively identify deepfakes, curtail the spread of harmful and illegal deepfakes, and minimize their impact on victims, thus striking a balance between reducing risk and promoting technological development.},

In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of MLLMs, delving deeply into discussions surrounding these critical issues. First of all, we start by presenting an overview of MLLMs, covering their evolutions, key techniques, and multilingual capacities. Secondly, we explore the multilingual training corpora of MLLMs and the multilingual datasets oriented for downstream tasks that are crucial to enhance the cross-lingual capability of MLLMs. Thirdly, we survey the state-of-the-art studies of multilingual representations and investigate whether the current MLLMs can learn a universal language representation. Fourthly, we discuss bias on MLLMs, including its categories, evaluation metrics, and debiasing techniques. Finally, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions of MLLMs.},

With the investment of huge amount of time, resources, and budgets into researching and developing successful DNN models, it is important for us to protect its intellectual property rights (IPRs) as these models can be easily replicated, shared, or redistributed without the consent of the legitimate owners. So far, a robust protection scheme designed for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) does not exist yet. Thus, this chapter proposes a complete protection framework that includes both white-box and black-box protection to enforce IPR on different variants of RNN. Within the framework, a key gate was introduced for the idea of embedding keys to protect IPR. It designates methods to train RNN models in a specific way such that when an invalid or forged key is presented, the performance of the embedded RNN models will be deteriorated. Having said that, the key gate was inspired by the nature of RNN model, to govern the flow of hidden state and designed in such a way that no additional weight parameters were introduced.",

Such conversations are often made up of a large number of participants and are characterized by a fast pace. Platforms like X/Twitter and Hacker News (HN) allow users to respond to other users' posts, leading to a tree-like structure. Previous work focused on training supervised models on datasets obtained from debate portals like Kialo where authors provide polarity labels (i.e., support/attack) together with their posts. Such classifiers may yield suboptimal predictions for the noisier posts from X or HN, so we propose unsupervised prompting strategies for large language models instead. Our experimental evaluation found this approach to be more effective for X conversations than a model fine-tuned on Kialo debates, but less effective for HN posts (which are more technical and less argumentative). Finally, we provide an open-source application for converting discussions on these platforms into argument graphs.",

  journal = {Universal Access in the Information Society},
  abstract = {The webtoon industry is experiencing significant growth in terms of its user base and revenue, rapidly expanding from the local market to international ones. However, despite this growth, its accessibility has not improved significantly, with most efforts focusing on providing more webtoon content within the platform. Not much is known about who is excluded from the webtoon industry. To address this, this research particularly focuses on color vision deficiency (CVD) accessibility of webtoon content. Adapting the design science research framework, this research followed the four steps of design science research: problem identification and motivation, development and demonstration, evaluation, and communication. First, it organized the CVD issues in South Korea. Then, it proposed a technical solution using a deep learning model. Specifically, this research used a Pix2Pix generative adversarial network-based recoloring algorithm and provided the translated images. We evaluated the solution by using colorblind filtering and in-depth interviews with individuals with CVD. This research provides a well-rounded accessibility study on the webtoon domain by identifying issues, proposing a deep learning solution, and evaluating that algorithm with the people with CVD. A total of seven CVD issues in webtoon contents have been identified. Deep learning-based image translation model has been developed to improve the accessibility of CVD people to webtoon content. This study contributes to both CVD and media accessibility by structurally organizing the sequence of problem solving for accessibility issues in the webtoon domain.},

abstract="With the emergence of powerful generative AI technologies and the increasing prevalence of high-risk AI systems in society, the conversation around the regulation of AI has gained critical global traction. Meanwhile, policymakers and regulators are struggling to stay on top of technological advances in AI. Our work uses an interdisciplinary approach combining computational linguistics, law, and sociology to examine the developments in policy discourses around the AI Act (AIA) in the European Union (EU) and their implications for global AI policy. We base our analysis on findings from an ongoing study of multi-stakeholder feedback to the AI Act, leveraging Natural Language Inference (NLI) to examine the language used by diverse stakeholders to justify viewpoints for and against the AIA. Based on the outcomes of that analysis and engaging an AI policy perspective, we examine how those initial discourses are reflected in the amendments to the AI Act during the EU co-legislative process. The study is anchored on identified trends of contentious points in the regulation, such as the definition of AI, general principles, prohibited practices, a tiered approach to foundation models, general-purpose and generative AI, high-risk categorization as well as measures supporting innovation, such as AI regulatory sandboxes. We reflect on the implications of emerging discourses, regulatory policies, and experimental frameworks for global AI governance. Our take is that experimental regulation, such as regulatory sandboxes, can offer a window of opportunity to incorporate a global perspective and produce better-informed regulation and governance of AI.",

abstract="This study describes a technique to use watermarking To secure Deep Neural Networks' (DNNs)' intellectual property rights. To watermark data, a watermark can be inserted into the trainable parameters of the network, which is known as ``white box watermarking'', or into the network's input-output mapping according to specific inputs (black box watermarking). Watermarking makes it difficult to ensure robustness to network modifications such as fine-tuning, model compression, and transfer learning. The watermark message is encoded in the network's fixed weights, whose placement is defined by a secret key, for this reason. These weights are set before training and are not modified during it. The spread of watermarked weights is tuned to large amplitudes to increase resilience, while being optimized to be indistinguishable from non-watermarked weights. Experiments show that the proposed approach is able to handle large payloads without significantly affecting the accuracy of the network, and is resistant to various types of network modifications and reuse.",

abstract="Machine Learning-based approaches for detection of malware files or execution of malware have been experiencing growing attention both in academia and in the security industry. With an ever-increasing flood of new threats, the promise of these approaches is to establish a more proactive posture as compared to other methods such as signatures and heuristics. However, operating Machine Learning systems in a production environment is not a trivial task and often overlooked in academic works. In this work, we are giving an overview of the additional requirements, constraints, and complications stemming from running a Machine Learning model as part of such a larger system in an industry setting. This includes model-specific requirements, such as target false-positive rates, corpus size, and corpus diversity, and system-specific needs, such as false-positive/false-negative mitigation, robustness and cost of the model generation process, establishment of feedback mechanisms, deployment considerations, and implementation constraints. Lastly, we touch on common compliance and contractual considerations.",

While researchers have investigated how to speed up the process of screening studies for potential inclusion, few have focused on to what extent we can use algorithms to extract data instead of human coders. In this study, we explore to what extent analyses and algorithms can produce results similar to human data extraction during a scoping review—a type of systematic review aimed at understanding the nature of the field rather than the efficacy of an intervention—in the context of a never before analyzed sample of studies that were intended for a scoping review. Specifically, we tested five approaches: bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with bag of words, k-means clustering with TF-IDF, Sentence-BERT, or SPECTER, hierarchical clustering with Sentence-BERT, and BERTopic. Our results showed that topic modeling approaches (LDA/BERTopic) and k-means clustering identified specific, but often narrow research areas, leaving a substantial portion of the sample unclassified or in unclear topics. Meanwhile, bibliometric analysis and hierarchical clustering with SBERT were more informative for our purposes, identifying key author networks and categorizing studies into distinct themes as well as reflecting the relationships between themes, respectively. Overall, we highlight the capabilities and limitations of each method and discuss how these techniques can complement traditional human data extraction methods. We conclude that the analyses tested here likely cannot fully replace human data extraction in scoping reviews but serve as valuable supplements.},

abstract="The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology raises important ethical considerations for the field of education. As AI systems become more advanced and capable of tasks like grading, providing instructional content, and even teaching classes, we must examine the ethical implications and ensure AI is implemented in educationally and socially responsible ways. This potential for progress hinges on navigating a complex ethical issue. Biases embedded in algorithms, student data privacy concerns, and the potential for AI to exacerbate educational inequalities all demand careful consideration. Most importantly the collection and use of student data raise privacy concerns. As AI tutors gather student information to personalize learning pathways, ensuring the security and responsible use of this data is paramount. Clear guidelines and regulations are necessary to establish student data ownership and control, preventing its misuse for profiling or manipulation. The human element in education remains irreplaceable. While AI excels at targeted practice and data analysis, it cannot replicate the empathy, creativity, and social-emotional learning fostered by human interaction. The ideal scenario involves AI as a powerful tool augmenting, not supplanting, human educators. Teachers can leverage AI to personalize instruction and identify struggling students, allowing them to dedicate more time to fostering critical thinking, collaboration, and social skills.",

abstract="Although significant progress has been made in single-image shadow detection or single-image shadow removal, only few works consider these two problems together. However, the two problems are complementary and can benefit from each other. In this work, we propose a Mask-Guided Residual Learning Network (MGRLN-Net) that jointly estimates shadow mask and shadow-free image. In particular, MGRLN-Net first generates a shadow mask, then utilizes a feature reassembling module to align the features from the shadow detection module to the shadow removal module. Finally, we leverage the learned shadow mask as guidance to generate a shadow-free image. We formulate shadow removal as a masked residual learning problem of the original shadow image. In this way, the learned shadow mask is used as guidance to produce better transitions in penumbra regions. Extensive experiments on ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on both shadow detection and shadow removal tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/LeipingJie/MGRLN-Net.",

abstract="The use of artificial intelligence and robotics in the media is no longer a novelty and is rapidly entering all areas of life, including the media. Now, a robot can replace the news anchor, the moderator of TV shows, and more. Artificial intelligence can write the text of a news story, select news sources, and also edit the footage of a television news report. Is it ethical for the public to be informed by a robot or artificial intelligence machine? To what extent is it moral and acceptable to use artificial intelligence technology and robotics in the production and serving of news content? A declaration of authorship, indicating that the content was created by artificial intelligence or a journalist, would be one of the ethical solutions, but not everyone can be transparent and conscientious. The use of artificial intelligence also brings a series of ethical and moral implications to the media, which you need to anticipate so that tomorrow does not return to us as a boomerang. This urgent need has prompted various governance proposals, including the ``OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence'' in 2019. In 2022, the United Nations member states published the ``Principles for Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in the United Nations System.'' In 2021, UNESCO also published the ``Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence,'' and the EU has established the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies.

  title = {Beyond Preferences in AI Alignment},
  year = {2024},
  journal = {Philosophical Studies},
  abstract = {The dominant practice of AI alignment assumes (1) that preferences are an adequate representation of human values, (2) that human rationality can be understood in terms of maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, and (3) that AI systems should be aligned with the preferences of one or more humans to ensure that they behave safely and in accordance with our values. Whether implicitly followed or explicitly endorsed, these commitments constitute what we term a preferentist approach to AI alignment. In this paper, we characterize and challenge the preferentist approach, describing conceptual and technical alternatives that are ripe for further research. We first survey the limits of rational choice theory as a descriptive model, explaining how preferences fail to capture the thick semantic content of human values, and how utility representations neglect the possible incommensurability of those values. We then critique the normativity of expected utility theory (EUT) for humans and AI, drawing upon arguments showing how rational agents need not comply with EUT, while highlighting how EUT is silent on which preferences are normatively acceptable. Finally, we argue that these limitations motivate a reframing of the targets of AI alignment: Instead of alignment with the preferences of a human user, developer, or humanity-writ-large, AI systems should be aligned with normative standards appropriate to their social roles, such as the role of a general-purpose assistant. Furthermore, these standards should be negotiated and agreed upon by all relevant stakeholders. On this alternative conception of alignment, a multiplicity of AI systems will be able to serve diverse ends, aligned with normative standards that promote mutual benefit and limit harm despite our plural and divergent values.},

year="2024",
publisher="Springer Nature Switzerland",
address="Cham",
pages="3--22",
abstract="Designing seamless, frictionless user experiences has long been a dominant trend in both applied behavioral science and artificial intelligence (AI), in which the goal of making desirable actions easy and efficient informs efforts to minimize friction in user experiences. However, in some settings, friction can be genuinely beneficial, such as the insertion of deliberate delays to increase reflection, preventing individuals from resorting to automatic or biased behaviors, and enhancing opportunities for unexpected discoveries. More recently, the popularization and availability of AI on a widespread scale has only increased the need to examine how friction can help or hinder users of AI; it also suggests a need to consider how positive friction can benefit AI practitioners, both during development processes (e.g., working with diverse teams) and to inform how AI is designed into offerings. This paper first proposes a `positive friction' model that can help characterize how friction is currently beneficial in user and developer experiences with AI, diagnose the potential need for friction where it may not yet exist in these contexts, and inform how positive friction can be used to generate solutions, especially as advances in AI continue to be progress and new opportunities emerge. It then explores this model in the context of AI users and developers by proposing the value of taking a hybrid `AI+human' lens, and concludes by suggesting questions for further exploration.",

However, we also demonstrate that machine learning (ML) techniques can discern even subtle deceptive tactics with an accuracy exceeding 80%, given sufficient domain expertise.

abstract="The linkage between scientific and technological knowledge is how academic discoveries are translated into real-world applications. The study focuses on the relationship between scientific articles and patents, highlighting the importance of understanding how scientific knowledge transcends the academic environment and contributes to technological advancement and innovation. The methodology includes the following steps: defining the research topic and search terms; searching for scientific articles in the Web of Science database and patents in the Derwent Innovations Index database; merging and importing metadata into Bibliometrix; analyzing the performance of the corpus by identifying indicators for scientific articles and patents; identifying the most frequent keywords and coding them into unigrams; obtaining thematic maps of the bigrams of patent abstracts, articles, and patents/articles; selecting documents for qualitative analysis. About qualitative, we present a metaverse governance analysis model. To illustrate the methodology, research was conducted about the metaverse. The results included identifying motor, basic, niche, and emerging themes within the context of the metaverse. The study highlighted the importance of an integrated approach to understanding the linkage between science and technology, contributing to promoting innovation and disseminating knowledge.",

  abstract = {Navigation is a fundamental component of modern information application systems, ranging from military, transportations, and logistic, to explorations. Traditional navigations are based on an absolute coordination system that provides a precise map of the physical world, the locations of the moving objects, and the optimized navigation routes. In recent years, many new emerging applications have presented new demands for navigation, e.g., underwater/underground navigations where no GPS or other localizations are available, an un-explored area with no maps, and task-oriented navigations without specific routes. The advances in IoT and AI enable us to design new navigation paradigms, embodied navigation that allows the moving object to interact with the physical world to obtain the local map, localize the objects, and optimize the navigation routes accordingly. We make a systematic and comprehensive review of research in embodied navigation, encompassing key aspects on perceptions, navigation and efficiency optimization. Beyond advancements in these areas, we also examine the emerging tasks enabled by embodied navigation which require flexible mobility in diverse and evolving environments. Moreover, we identify the challenges associated with deploying embodied navigation systems in the real world and extend them to substantial areas. We aim for this article to provide valuable insights into this rapidly developing field, fostering future research to close existing gaps and advance the development of general-purpose autonomous systems grounded in embodied navigation.},

Recently, deep learning methods have emerged as a solution to the task of automatic music generation (AMG) using symbolic tokens in a target style, but their superiority over non-deep learning methods has not been demonstrated. Here, we conduct a listening study to comparatively evaluate several music generation systems along six musical dimensions: stylistic success, aesthetic pleasure, repetition or self-reference, melody, harmony, and rhythm. A range of models, both deep learning algorithms and other methods, are used to generate 30-s excerpts in the style of Classical string quartets and classical piano improvisations. Fifty participants with relatively high musical knowledge rate unlabelled samples of computer-generated and human-composed excerpts for the six musical dimensions. We use non-parametric Bayesian hypothesis testing to interpret the results, allowing the possibility of finding meaningful non-differences between systems’ performance. We find that the strongest deep learning method, a reimplemented version of Music Transformer, has equivalent performance to a non-deep learning method, MAIA Markov, demonstrating that to date, deep learning does not outperform other methods for AMG. We also find there still remains a significant gap between any algorithmic method and human-composed excerpts.},

The EU Parliament approved the initial draft in May 2023. Trilogue meetings took place in June, July, September and October 2023, with the aim for the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission to adopt a final version early 2024. This is the first attempt to build a legally binding legal instrument on Artificial Intelligence in the European Union (EU). In a similar way as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU AI Act has an extraterritorial effect. It has, therefore, the potential to become a global gold standard for AI regulation. It may also contribute to developing a global consensus on AI Trustworthiness because AI providers must conduct conformity assessments for high-risk AI systems prior to entry into the EU market. As the AI Act contains limited guidelines on how to conduct conformity assessments and ex-post monitoring in practice, there is a need for consensus building on this topic. This paper aims at studying the governance structure proposed by the EU AI Act, as approved by the European Council in November 2022, and proposes tools to conduct conformity assessments of AI systems.},

abstract="In this paper, we propose Neural Spectrum Decomposition, a generic decomposition framework for dataset distillation. Unlike previous methods, we consider the entire dataset as a high-dimensional observation that is low-rank across all dimensions. We aim to discover the low-rank representation of the entire dataset and perform distillation efficiently. Toward this end, we learn a set of spectrum tensors and transformation matrices, which, through simple matrix multiplication, reconstruct the data distribution. Specifically, a spectrum tensor can be mapped back to the image space by a transformation matrix, and efficient information sharing during the distillation learning process is achieved through pairwise combinations of different spectrum vectors and transformation matrices. Furthermore, we integrate a trajectory matching optimization method guided by a real distribution. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny Imagenet, and ImageNet Subset.

abstract="Tensor decomposition is a powerful unsupervised machine learning technique capable of modeling multidimensional data, including that related to malware. This chapter discusses a method that employs tensor decomposition for malware analysis. We introduce an innovative ensemble semi-supervised classification algorithm named Random Forest of Tensors (RFoT). RFoT leverages tensor decomposition to extract intricate latent patterns from the data. Our hybrid model combines multidimensional analysis with clustering to capture sample groupings within latent components, aiding in distinguishing between malware and benign-ware. The patterns extracted from malware data using tensor decomposition heavily rely on the configuration of the tensor, including dimension, entry, and rank selection. To encompass diverse perspectives offered by different tensor configurations, we adopt the ``wisdom of crowds'' philosophy. This involves leveraging decisions made by the majority within a randomly generated ensemble of tensors, varying in dimensions, entries, and ranks. We illustrate RFoT's effectiveness in classifying Windows Portable Executable (PE) malware and benign-ware. To promote the utility of tensor decomposition for malware analysis and ensure the reproducibility of our results, we have made our code publicly available.",

  abstract = {The extraction of atomic-level material features from electron microscope images is crucial for studying structure-property relationships and discovering new materials. However, traditional electron microscope analyses rely on time-consuming and complex human operations; thus, they are only applicable to images with a small number of atoms. In addition, the analysis results vary due to observers’ individual deviations. Although efforts to introduce automated methods have been performed previously, many of these methods lack sufficient labeled data or require various conditions in the detection process that can only be applied to the target material. Thus, in this study, we developed AtomGAN, which is a robust, unsupervised learning method, that segments defects in classical 2D material systems and the heterostructures of MoS2/WS2 automatically. To solve the data scarcity problem, the proposed model is trained on unpaired simulated data that contain point and line defects for MoS2/WS2. The proposed AtomGAN was evaluated on both simulated and real electron microscope images. The results demonstrate that the segmented point defects and line defects are presented perfectly in the resulting figures, with a measurement precision of 96.9%. In addition, the cycled structure of AtomGAN can quickly generate a large number of simulated electron microscope images.},

  abstract = {In recent years, internet technology has grown in advance, and multimedia data-sharing growth rates have skyrocketed. As a result, protecting multimedia data in digital networks has become a significant problem. Multimedia data such as audio, text, video, and image are highly used as a data-sharing communication system which demands security, particularly in image and video. Digital watermarking is the one solution that has gained widespread recognition over the past two decades for data embedding in image and video, a key tactic in multimedia tamper detection and recovery. The review tells about the growth rate and data breaches on multimedia data across different applications, which raises the issue of multimedia security. Notably, social network platforms are highly targeted due to their rapid growth, which has created opportunities for data breaches and multimedia manipulation. Here, the forensic field comes into play, where some data-hiding strategies are used to look for evidence of tampering. Even though watermarking techniques can attain security in tamper detection, they face some issues and challenges across various applications. This motivated us to analyze the existing work carried out by data hiding watermarking techniques in the field of multimedia tamper detection in detail and the gap analyzed. Overall, dataset availability, watermarking performance quality metrics, and several image-processing attacks are all explicitly mentioned. This review paper discusses a comprehensive study of the existing system in the field of tamper detection (both in Image and Video) in detail. Also, the development of existing watermarking techniques, issues, and challenges are covered in detail in this paper.},

In this article, we compare the information gleaned from the study of the fortified cities of the Early Historic period of the Indian subcontinent (c. 3rd century BCE to 4th century CE) with the precolonial medieval era (9-17th centuries CE). Utilizing in-depth archaeological and historical studies along with local sightings and citizen-science blogs to create a comprehensive data set and map series in a “big-data” approach that makes use of heterogeneous data sets and presence-absence criteria, we discuss how the architecture of warfare shifted from an emphasis on urban defense in the Early Historic period to an emphasis on territorial offense and defense in the medieval period. Many medieval fortifications are known from only local reports and have minimal identifying information but can still be studied in the aggregate using a least-shared denominator approach to quantification and mapping.},

abstract="The use of artificial intelligence and robotics in the media is no longer a novelty and is rapidly entering all areas of life, including the media. Now, a robot can replace the news anchor, the moderator of TV shows, and more. Artificial intelligence can write the text of a news story, select news sources, and also edit the footage of a television news report. Is it ethical for the public to be informed by a robot or artificial intelligence machine? To what extent is it moral and acceptable to use artificial intelligence technology and robotics in the production and serving of news content? A declaration of authorship, indicating that the content was created by artificial intelligence or a journalist, would be one of the ethical solutions, but not everyone can be transparent and conscientious. The use of artificial intelligence also brings a series of ethical and moral implications to the media, which you need to anticipate so that tomorrow does not return to us as a boomerang. This urgent need has prompted various governance proposals, including the ``OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence'' in 2019. In 2022, the United Nations member states published the ``Principles for Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in the United Nations System.'' In 2021, UNESCO also published the ``Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence,'' and the EU has established the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies. But these initiatives need to extend to lower levels of governance as well, and the establishment of ethics committees on the use of artificial intelligence in media and beyond should be undertaken by every state.",

  year = {2025},
  journal = {International Journal of Computer Vision},
  abstract = {With the explosive popularity of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation has recently received a lot of attention. Generating videos guided by text instructions poses significant challenges, such as modeling the complex relationship between space and time, and the lack of large-scale text-video paired data. Existing text-video datasets suffer from limitations in both content quality and scale, or they are not open-source, rendering them inaccessible for study and use. For model design, previous approaches extend pretrained text-to-image generation models by adding temporal 1D convolution/attention modules for video generation. However, these approaches overlook the importance of jointly modeling space and time, inevitably leading to temporal distortions and misalignment between texts and videos. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that strengthens the interaction between spatial and temporal perceptions. In particular, we utilize a swapped cross-attention mechanism in 3D windows that alternates the “query” role between spatial and temporal blocks, enabling mutual reinforcement for each other. Moreover, to fully unlock model capabilities for high-quality video generation and promote the development of the field, we curate a large-scale and open-source video dataset called HD-VG-130M. This dataset comprises 130 million text-video pairs from the open-domain, ensuring high-definition, widescreen and watermark-free characters. A smaller-scale yet more meticulously cleaned subset further enhances the data quality, aiding models in achieving superior performance. Experimental quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of per-frame quality, temporal correlation, and text-video alignment, with clear margins.},

abstract="This chapter explores a process perspective of political theories as it applies to mediating the climate crisis. Reflecting the ongoing self-reflexivity of process thinking, the chapter also confronts the potential political biases of the author by reflecting on process philosophy, peace studies and personal leanings in relation to left and right political ideologies. While recognising inadequacies of left-right categories, a partial alignment of process politics with the left, right and centre of the political spectrum is uncovered, and a new (multi-dimensional, processual) way to think about these political categories is explored. The basic orientations of process thinking are applied to aspects of Marxist, social democratic, capitalist and neoliberal political theories, identifying intersections and divergences of process perspectives. It explores the ways that static biases arise when ideas, ideologies or assumptions (e.g. about human nature) are treated as fixed and unchanging or are reduced to a single dimension. Grounded in process metaphysics, the process-based political theory developed emphasises the participatory and generative agency of social actors within the limitations of their material and historical contexts, and the possibilities for change in ideas and actions to evolve structural barriers that support peace with justice. The emerging theory connects with George Monbiot's ``politics of belonging'' extended with process notions of ``communities of communities'' and transcending pro/anti-capitalist divides. This process politics does not seek a political revolution nor superficial reform but an integral transformation resonating with John Dewey's vision of ``creative democracy.'' Foundational to process politics is a more equal distribution of power, decoupling the influence of wealth over democracy, and re-regulating markets in the interests of long-term human and nonhuman wellbeing. Utilising the static-process framework and process metaphysics, Chaps. 5and 6demonstrate diverging and converging alliances of political and economic theories that can be understood in terms of hegemonic static thinking and encompassing process thinking. Together with the contextual economics, this chapter shows how process philosophy supports more participatory policymaking and multi-scale interventions to enable the co-creation of more peaceful and sustainable futures.",

Fixations to these referents provides insight into the preliminary states of language processing as decisions unfold. The VWP has become the dominant paradigm in psycholinguistics and extended to every level of language, development, and disorders. Part of its impact is the impressive data visualizations which reveal the millisecond-by-millisecond time course of processing, and advances have been made in developing new analyses that precisely characterize this time course. All theoretical and statistical approaches make the tacit assumption that the time course of fixations is closely related to the underlying activation in the system. However, given the serial nature of fixations and their long refractory period, it is unclear how closely the observed dynamics of the fixation curves are actually coupled to the underlying dynamics of activation. I investigated this assumption with a series of simulations. Each simulation starts with a set of true underlying activation functions and generates simulated fixations using a simple stochastic sampling procedure that respects the sequential nature of fixations. I then analyzed the results to determine the conditions under which the observed fixations curves match the underlying functions, the reliability of the observed data, and the implications for Type I error and power. These simulations demonstrate that even under the simplest fixation-based models, observed fixation curves are systematically biased relative to the underlying activation functions, and they are substantially noisier, with important implications for reliability and power. I then present a potential generative model that may ultimately overcome many of these issues.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) academic publications commonly provide open-source implementations on GitHub, allowing their audience to replicate, validate, or even extend the ML algorithms, data sets and metadata. However, thus far little is known about the degree of collaboration activity happening on such ML research repositories, in particular regarding (1) the degree to which such repositories receive contributions from forks, (2) the nature of such contributions (i.e., the types of changes), and (3) the nature of changes that are not contributed back to forks, which might represent missed opportunities. In this paper, we empirically study contributions to 1,346 ML research repositories and their 67,369 forks, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by building on Hindle et al.’s seminal taxonomy of code changes. We found that while ML research repositories are heavily forked, only 9% of the forks made modifications to the forked repository. 42% of the latter sent changes to the parent repositories, half of which (52%) were accepted by the parent repositories. Our qualitative analysis on 539 contributed and 378 local (fork-only) changes extends Hindle et al.’s taxonomy with two new top-level change categories related to ML (Data and Dependency Management), and 16 new sub-categories, including nine ML-specific ones (input data, parameter tuning, pre-processing, training infrastructure, model structure, pipeline performance, sharing, validation infrastructure, and output data). While the changes that are not contributed back by the forks mostly concern domain-specific features and local experimentation (e.g., parameter tuning), the origin repositories do miss out on a non-trivial 15.4% of Documentation changes, 13.6% of Feature changes and 11.4% of Bug fix changes.},

So, image authenticity has questioned. Some people use the forged image for fun, but some people may have bad intentions. The manipulated image may use by political parties to spread their false propaganda. Fake images use by people to spread rumours and stoking someone. In addition to harming individuals, fake images can damage the credibility of media outlets and undermine the public trust in them.

Label-free optical technologies, on the other hand, do not rely on exogenous and artificial markers, by exploiting intrinsic optical contrast mechanisms, where the specificity is typically less obvious to the human observer. Over the past few years, digital staining has emerged as a promising concept to use modern deep learning for the translation from optical contrast to established biochemical contrast of actual stainings. In this review article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the-art in this field, suggest methods of good practice, identify pitfalls and challenges and postulate promising advances towards potential future implementations and applications.},

One example is the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition, which promotes rights-based principles for Internet governance at global as well as local level. Likewise, the Council of Europe has issued more than 50 recommendations that apply a human rights lens to, for example, social media platforms, Internet intermediaries and AI. The uptake of the human right framework is also echoed amongst scholars from a variety of disciplines, which now interrogate developments in global media and technology from a rights-based perspective. Against the backdrop of these developments, the chapter examines (1) the extent to which global media and technology has strengthened or undermined the human rights framework; (2) the contribution of a rights-based approach in addressing contentious issues in global media and technology policy, for example, related to access, diversity, expression rights, privacy and governance; and finally (3) the future role that human rights may play in envisioning and challenging policy responses to current and emerging issues in the global media and technology domain such as tech giants, surveillance capitalism, AI and automated decision-making.",

  abstract = {The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) plays a crucial role in identifying security threats that can compromise data integrity within networks and critical business infrastructure. Current research faces challenges in achieving a high recall rate while maintaining an acceptable analysis time, particularly when dealing with large-scale network traffic data. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel combined model that integrates the Memory-Augmented Visual Attention Network (MAVAN) with the Golden Predator Search Algorithm (GoPSA), referred to as MAVAN-GoPSA, for effective intrusion detection and classification. MAVAN enhances feature extraction by incorporating visual attention and memory elements, allowing the model to focus on relevant features while preserving the contextual information necessary for accurate classification. Meanwhile, GoPSA improves the feature selection process through a search algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation to identify the most pertinent features for intrusion detection. The performance of the MAVAN-GoPSA model is evaluated against eight different techniques across three datasets: NSL-KDD, CICIoT-2023, and UNSW-NB 15, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results demonstrate that this hybrid model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an impressive accuracy of up to 99.2% across several datasets. Thus, the authors present a practical and effective approach to NIDS that successfully addresses the limitations of previous methods, ultimately enhancing network security.},

To overcome these shortcomings, this method proposes (i) Moving Object (MO) detection, (ii) FE, (iii) data hiding, and (iv) data encryption. Initially, the MO in the video are detected using optical flow and tracking the weight of MO. Next, data hiding features are extracted using Optimization Fruit fly Algorithm (OFA) with Differential Evolution (DE) and Opposition Based Learning (OBL) algorithm. Then, a modified data hiding techniques based on correlation, regression and pixel segmentation with Prediction Error (PE) techniques are used for improving the performance. Finally, the hidden data is encrypted using Binary Tree Structure (BTS) to provide additional layer of security. Experimental result shows the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), embedding capacity and security analysis.},

Using multiple case studies, we examined this framework against teacher perceptions of how design should be taught and the observed instructional practices of those secondary educators. We argue that refinement to the IDTL Matrix is warranted and suggest expanding the framework to include design strategies that address collaborative learning, peer communication, and the integration of digital and non-digital tools and materials. Such revisions to the IDTL Matrix would contribute to providing the best possible support to teachers who seek to develop their students’ design strategies in classroom contexts.},

  abstract = {3D pose transfer over unorganized point clouds is a challenging generation task, which transfers a source’s pose to a target shape and keeps the target’s identity. Recent deep models have learned deformations and used the target’s identity as a style to modulate the combined features of two shapes or the aligned vertices of the source shape. However, all operations in these models are point-wise and independent and ignore the geometric information on the surface and structure of the input shapes. This disadvantage severely limits the generation and generalization capabilities. In this study, we propose a geometry-aware method based on a novel transformer autoencoder to solve this problem. An efficient self-attention mechanism, that is, cross-covariance attention, was utilized across our framework to perceive the correlations between points at different distances. Specifically, the transformer encoder extracts the target shape’s local geometry details for identity attributes and the source shape’s global geometry structure for pose information. Our transformer decoder efficiently learns deformations and recovers identity properties by fusing and decoding the extracted features in a geometry attentional manner, which does not require corresponding information or modulation steps. The experiments demonstrated that the geometry-aware method achieved state-of-the-art performance in a 3D pose transfer task. The implementation code and data are available at https://github.com/SEULSH/Geometry-Aware-3D-Pose-Transfer-Using-Transformer-Autoencoder.},

In other words, the burden is on the victim to identify the responsible party and to prove the fault, damage, and causal link. In the absence of targeted measures to ease the burden of proof, the specific characteristics of certain AI-systems could make it extremely difficult and/or prohibitively expensive for victims to identify and prove the fault of a potentially liable person as well as the causal link between that fault and the damage suffered. Tracing the victim's loss back to the defendant may be challenging if the suspected cause of that loss is related to the operation of an AI system, due to the increasingly autonomous nature of some AI systems and their peculiar characteristics.",

The design companies to reduce the operating costs and facilitate mass production of integrated circuits, outsource their fabrication to third-party foundries. This process increases the risk of intrusion attacks in the form of hardware viruses, also known as hardware trojans viruses. Hardware trojans viruses are a critical problem that has the potential to become an outbreak in the coming years, presenting a significant threat both technologically and socially. In this chapter book, is presented an extensive reference to hardware trojans viruses, their existence, their structures and models, their attacks, their taxonomy, and the difficulties in dealing with them. An overview of artificial intelligence is presented like the tasks of learning and the learning models. A comprehensive review of research dedicated to countermeasures against hardware trojans, like conventional side-channel analysis and logic testing as well as artificial intelligence techniques and auxiliary approaches, is presented. And lastly, how to build artificial intelligence models against hardware trojans is presented. Specifically, techniques for data collection, examination, and visualization as well as for the training and evaluation of the models are mentioned.",

The kinds of knowledge, insights and narratives that can be derived from such archival collections are examined. The authors propose knowledge graph as a suitable knowledge organisation scheme for representing items in the personal archives and their inter-relationships as well as links to concepts and resources on the Web. Three approaches to developing a knowledge graph are illustrated using the personal archive of two pioneer musicians and composers in post-World War II Singapore as case studies: Zubir Said and Leong Yoon Pin. A digital archive system comprising a graph database management system for storing the knowledge graph, and a graph visualisation interface for presenting the knowledge graph was developed. The initial results of a user study of the system and interface are described. The authors suggest that it is important for arts professionals to understand the development of their art in the locale in which they are practising, and to consider how their artistic practice can draw from the artistic heritage of the community. They refer to this kind of learning as a pedagogy of artistic tradition and heritage.",

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel loop closure detection algorithm that uses graph attention neural networks to encode semantic graphs to perform place recognition and then use semantic registration to estimate the 6 DoF relative pose constraint. Our place recognition algorithm has two key modules, namely, a semantic graph encoder module and a graph comparison module. The semantic graph encoder employs graph attention networks to efficiently encode spatial, semantic and geometric information from the semantic graph of the input point cloud. We then use self-attention mechanism in both node-embedding and graph-embedding steps to create distinctive graph vectors. The graph vectors of the current scan and a keyframe scan are then compared in the graph comparison module to identify a possible loop closure. Specifically, employing the difference of the two graph vectors showed a significant improvement in performance, as shown in ablation studies. Lastly, we implemented a semantic registration algorithm that takes in loop closure candidate scans and estimates the relative 6 DoF pose constraint for the LiDAR SLAM system. Extensive evaluation on public datasets shows that our model is more accurate and robust, achieving 13% improvement in maximum F1 score on the SemanticKITTI dataset, when compared to the baseline semantic graph algorithm. For the benefit of the community, we open-source the complete implementation of our proposed algorithm and custom implementation of semantic registration at https://github.com/crepuscularlight/SemanticLoopClosure.},

The sources of images are everywhere, magazines, newspapers, healthcare, entertainment, education, social media and electronic media. With the advancement of image editing software and cheap camera-enabled mobile devices, image manipulation is very easy without any prior knowledge or expertise. So, image authenticity has questioned. Some people use the forged image for fun, but some people may have bad intentions. The manipulated image may use by political parties to spread their false propaganda. Fake images use by people to spread rumours and stoking someone. In addition to harming individuals, fake images can damage the credibility of media outlets and undermine the public trust in them. The need for reliable and efficient image forgery detection methods to combat misinformation, propaganda, hoaxes, and other malicious uses of manipulated images. These are some known issues on digital images. The researcher, scientist, and image forensic experts are working on the development of fake image detection and identification tools. Presently digital image forgery detection is a trending field of research. The main aim of this paper is to provide the exhaustive review on digital image forgery detection tools and techniques. It also discusses various machine learning techniques, such as supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches, that can be employed for image forgery detection it demonstrate the challenges of the current state of the work.},

abstract="The chapter argues that cultural heritage objects fit within the established system of civil law objects. The main reason they fall outside the scope of material objects is the intangibility or special legal status of some objects, such as human remains and living humans. It may also be impossible to take possession of heritage objects, as in the case of space cultural heritage. Some existing challenges have been present for some time, with changes in how we perceive certain phenomena intensifying and affecting the debate's outcome. Nevertheless, the technological progress that we can observe and its use in artistic or functional forms (e.g., a diamond made of human remains) or unique artwork (e.g., Tim) make it necessary to refer to this problem in terms of safeguarding cultural heritage. Another challenge is posed by the digitization of culture, including non-tangible artistic expressions that are now offered for sale as NFTs or only available as online files without a tangible carrier. The fragmentation of national cultural heritage legislation in Poland is presented via the example of the Act on Fryderyk Chopin's cultural heritage.",

This framework provides a detailed list of indicators that are interconnected and cover a holistic view on sustainable development. The goals were defined by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015 and expected to be achieved by 2030. Since the release of this agenda, the research community has begun to intensify work in these areas, yet these efforts seem to be relatively limited. This is especially true about the employment of data and artificial intelligence (AI), which are not widely engaged in SDG-related topics. The AI-based research on SDGs and further developments depends heavily on the availability and accessibility of related real-world data collected by the community. However, there is no central, structured, and holistic database of datasets and metadata associated with the SDGs, which prevents large-scale collaboration on these topics. In this paper, we present the SDG Data Catalog, a global open-source database indexing SDG-related datasets, associated metadata, and research networks. We describe the construction of this catalog, which relies on state-of-the-art natural language processing models with human supervision. The catalog breaks down data silos and helps sustainability researchers navigate the data sea to initiate effective collaborations.",

abstract="Estonia is a civil law country with codified legislation and strong Germanic influences. The primary source of law is statutory law, whereas case law from the Supreme Court is binding for practical purposes, especially in cases where no explicit statutory provision exists. Scholarly writing and explanatory notes are important interpretive tools but not strictly binding sources of law. The court system is organised in a three-tier hierarchy where administrative and district courts serve as courts of first instance, two circuit courts as courts of appeal and the Supreme Court as a court of cassation and constitutional review. With a trend towards specialisation, the court system looks more like three separate hierarchies---administrative, civil, and criminal court systems. A high degree of professionalisation is guaranteed by high-level legal education. A 3-year bachelor's degree in law combined with 2-year master's is considered the basic qualification for admission to classical legal professions. Mobility between different professions is encouraged through mutual recognition of entry examinations between the judiciary, the prosecutor's office, and the bar association. The legal order is monist, and, therefore, binding international law forms part of domestic law. International treaties and international court practice can be directly relied upon in domestic courts. A high degree of and a positive attitude towards the internationalisation of law and international impulses are important features of the Estonian legal culture.",

In this chapter we provide a workflow for utilizing CAMEOS to create synthetic overlaps between two genes, one essential (infA) and one non-essential (aroB), to protect the non-essential gene from mutation and loss of protein function. In this workflow we detail the methods to collect large numbers of related protein sequences, produce multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), use the MSAs to generate hidden Markov models and Markov random field models, and finally generate a library of overlapping coding sequences through CAMEOS scripts. To assist practitioners with basic coding skills to try out the CAMEOS method, we have created a virtual machine containing all the required packages already installed that can be downloaded and run locally.",

abstract="As a common security tool, visible watermarking has been widely applied to protect copyrights of digital images. However, recent works have shown that visible watermarks can be removed by DNNs without damaging their host images. Such watermark-removal techniques pose a great threat to the ownership of images. Inspired by the vulnerability of DNNs on adversarial perturbations, we propose a novel defence mechanism by adversarial machine learning for good. From the perspective of the adversary, blind watermark-removal networks can be posed as our target models; then we actually optimize an imperceptible adversarial perturbation on the host images to proactively attack against watermark-removal networks, dubbed Watermark Vaccine. Specifically, two types of vaccines are proposed. Disrupting Watermark Vaccine (DWV) induces to ruin the host image along with watermark after passing through watermark-removal networks. In contrast, Inerasable Watermark Vaccine (IWV) works in another fashion of trying to keep the watermark not removed and still noticeable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our DWV/IWV in preventing watermark removal, especially on various watermark removal networks.

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) allows computer models to learn, visualize, optimize, refine, and predict data. To understand its present state, examining the most recent advancements and applications of deep learning across various domains is essential. However, prior reviews focused on DL applications in only one or two domains. The current review thoroughly investigates the use of DL in four different broad fields due to the plenty of relevant research literature in these domains. This wide range of coverage provides a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of DL’s influence and opportunities, which is lacking in other reviews. The study also discusses DL frameworks and addresses the benefits and challenges of utilizing DL in each field, which is only occasionally available in other reviews. DL frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch make it easy to develop innovative DL applications across diverse domains by providing model development and deployment platforms. This helps bridge theoretical progress and practical implementation. Deep learning solves complex problems and advances technology in many fields, demonstrating its revolutionary potential and adaptability. CNN-LSTM models with attention mechanisms can forecast traffic with 99% accuracy. Fungal-diseased mango leaves can be classified with 97.13% accuracy by the multi-layer CNN model. However, deep learning requires rigorous data collection to analyze and process large amounts of data because it is independent of training data. Thus, large-scale medical, research, healthcare, and environmental data compilation are challenging, reducing deep learning effectiveness. Future research should address data volume, privacy, domain complexity, and data quality issues in DL datasets.},

Commonly acknowledging that the level of Internet development embodies national comprehensive strength, various countries actively promote strategic layout and contend for the dominant position in IT development. Generally speaking, Internet advances in twists and turns and develops in competition. The construction of infrastructure like 5G, IPv6, satellite Internet, IoT and industrial Internet continues to progress. Deeply integrated with emerging technologies like AI, quantum computing and blockchain, the construction of infrastructure sustainably boosts the development of digital industrialization, enhances traditional industries, drives the growth of the digital economy and injects new vitality into global economic recovery. Internet media develop in a diverse way, with multiple development paths of cultural communication and media convergence. As various countries step up efforts in strategic planning and layout of cybersecurity, the cybersecurity industry maintains a healthy development trend, and security-protection capacity continues to improve. The rule-of-law construction in cyberspace steadily advances, with more efforts invested in protecting cybersecurity and data privacy and combating cybercrime. Various countries make remarkable achievements in international governance of such issues as cross-border data, platforms and cybersecurity, which further reshapes international rules and order in cyberspace.",

abstract="Canonical surface mapping generalizes keypoint detection by assigning each pixel of an object to a corresponding point in a 3D template. Popularised by DensePose for the analysis of humans, authors have since attempted to apply the concept to more categories, but with limited success due to the high cost of manual supervision. In this work, we introduce SHIC, a method to learn canonical maps without manual supervision which achieves better results than supervised methods for most categories. Our idea is to leverage foundation computer vision models such as DINO and Stable Diffusion that are open-ended and thus possess excellent priors over natural categories. SHIC reduces the problem of estimating image-to-template correspondences to predicting image-to-image correspondences using features from the foundation models. The reduction works by matching images of the object to non-photorealistic renders of the template, which emulates the process of collecting manual annotations for this task. These correspondences are then used to supervise high-quality canonical maps for any object of interest. We also show that image generators can further improve the realism of the template views, which provide an additional source of supervision for the model.",

However, the implications of egg banking for the valuation of eggs remain little studied. Building on ethnographic fieldwork in a Ukrainian egg bank, in this article I examine different mechanisms and calculations that allow the bank to transform vitrified ova—products with volatile outcomes—into valuable but uncertain commodities. This article reveals how the bank staff can never completely secure their profits because of the variability of the egg quality assessment and unpredictability of their expenses. I demonstrate how the dilemmas that arise when the egg banking industry tries to turn oocytes into commodities trigger certain efforts to develop quality control in vitrification techniques and donor selection, as well as classification and accounting schemes related to oocyte quality.},

  abstract = {Fixational eye movements alter the number and timing of spikes transmitted from the retina to the brain, but whether these changes enhance or degrade the retinal signal is unclear. To quantify this, we developed a Bayesian method for reconstructing natural images from the recorded spikes of hundreds of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the macaque retina (male), combining a likelihood model for RGC light responses with the natural image prior implicitly embedded in an artificial neural network optimized for denoising. The method matched or surpassed the performance of previous reconstruction algorithms, and provides an interpretable framework for characterizing the retinal signal. Reconstructions were improved with artificial stimulus jitter that emulated fixational eye movements, even when the eye movement trajectory was assumed to be unknown and had to be inferred from retinal spikes. Reconstructions were degraded by small artificial perturbations of spike times, revealing more precise temporal encoding than suggested by previous studies. Finally, reconstructions were substantially degraded when derived from a model that ignored cell-to-cell interactions, indicating the importance of stimulus-evoked correlations. Thus, fixational eye movements enhance the precision of the retinal representation.},

abstract="Microwave Imaging (MWI) is a technique that allows to reconstruct an image of the internal structure of an object by irradiating the object with a known incident field and by acquiring and processing the scattered field. As such, MWI can be used as a diagnostic technique for various medical issues, such as brain stroke or breast cancer. However, the image reconstruction process entails a sequence of compute-intensive algorithms, which we call ``kernels.'' The kernels execution time might become an issue when the time to diagnosis is a key factor. To speed up the kernels execution, we can use hardware acceleration techniques. In this chapter, we will identify the complex computational kernels that are recurrent in MWI. Then, we present the methodologies to design specific hardware accelerators in Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for these kernels by means of an efficient design method called High Level Synthesis (HLS) and by several HLS-based hardware optimization techniques. In addition, we will present new methodologies for design automation in HLS-based hardware designs. The results show that the presented HLS optimizations and design automation techniques can significantly improve the efficiency of the hardware accelerator designs for MWI.",

  journal = {Computational Visual Media},
  pages = {1013-1030},
  abstract = {Semantic segmentation is an important sub-task for many applications. However, pixel-level ground-truth labeling is costly, and there is a tendency to overfit to training data, thereby limiting the generalization ability. Unsupervised domain adaptation can potentially address these problems by allowing systems trained on labelled datasets from the source domain (including less expensive synthetic domain) to be adapted to a novel target domain. The conventional approach involves automatic extraction and alignment of the representations of source and target domains globally. One limitation of this approach is that it tends to neglect the differences between classes: representations of certain classes can be more easily extracted and aligned between the source and target domains than others, limiting the adaptation over all classes. Here, we address this problem by introducing a Class-Conditional Domain Adaptation (CCDA) method. This incorporates a class-conditional multi-scale discriminator and class-conditional losses for both segmentation and adaptation. Together, they measure the segmentation, shift the domain in a class-conditional manner, and equalize the loss over classes. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our CCDA method matches, and in some cases, surpasses that of state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract="While the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations on traditional areas, i.e., agriculture, manufacturing, services, dumping, subsidies, product standards etc. are on, there are several emerging concerns that can influence the pace of multilateral cooperation significantly. First, the dispute settlement body (DSB) of the WTO is considered to be the safety valve of the multilateral system. For smooth functioning of the WTO framework and securing compliance with the composite set of agreements, the DSB needs to deliver justice in a time-bound manner. While many cases have been fought since inception, the high cost of fighting a dispute has considerably limited their attraction for the developing countries. The intervention from the US on WTO Appalate Body functioning in recent years can therefore bear far-reaching consequences, given the dynamics of protectionist intent in general and the emergence of newer non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in the post-Covid period in particular. Second, the growth in E-Commerce can facilitate competition and lower price, which can in turn augment consumer surplus. The recent objection of several countries against further liberalization on this front and reversal of the `moratorium' on application of customs duties with respect to electronic transmissions, needs to be viewed in the wider context of the recent growth and associated threat perception therein. Finally, the recent OECD guideline for securing a uniform 15 percent effective minimum tax on multinational enterprises from early 2024 onwards has been a welcome development towards enhancement of policy certainty.",

  abstract = {Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that may be diagnosed and monitored using routine diagnostic tests like Electroencephalography (EEG). However, manual introspection and analysis of EEG signals is presently difficult and repetitive task even for experienced neuro-technologists with high false-positive rates and inter- and intra-rater reliability. Software advancements using Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to early detect and predict abnormal patterns observed in EEG signals. The present review focuses on systematically reporting software advancements and their implementation using hardware systems in automatic epilepsy diagnosis and seizure detection for the past 10 years. Traditional, hybrid, and end-to-end AI-based pipelines and associated EEG datasets have been discussed. The review summarizes and compares reported articles, datasets, and patents through various subjective and objective parameters in this field. Latest advancements demonstrate that AI-based pipelines can reduce the introspection time by at least 50% without compromising the diagnostic accuracy or abnormal event detection. A significant rise in hardware implementation of software-based pipelines, end-to-end deep learning architectures for real-time analysis, and granted patents has been noticed since 2011. More than twenty-eight datasets have been developed to automatically diagnose epileptic EEG signals from 2001 to 2023. Extensive analysis using explainability tools, cross-dataset generalizations, reproducibility analysis, and ablation experiments can further improve the existing AI-based pipelines in this field. There is a need for the development of standardized protocols for data collection and its AI pipeline for a robust, inter- and intra-rater reliability-free, and real-time automatic epilepsy diagnosis.},

The actions on both sides have revealed a dissolution of ethical restraints, with unimaginably cruel attacks on civilians, murder of children, destruction of health facilities, and denial of basic needs such as water, food, and shelter. There is a need both to understand the nature of the ethical singularity represented by this conflict and what, if any, options are available to allow the reconstruction of communication between the warring parties. This article seeks to address these tasks by analysing the conflict as inherently an ethical one, in the sense that it exposes a rupture in the fabric of communicative relationships that has evolved systematically out of the deep cultural structures from which all protagonists have emerged. Drawing on the work of Levinas, Habermas, Arendt, and others, and referring to the specific circumstances in the region, it examines the ethical sources of the crisis and tries to identify conditions for its resolution. The possibility of reconciliation—that is, of refiguring relationships to open up a space for dialogue to create pathways to heal the ruptures—is examined. The dark legacy of the Holocaust is identified as an abiding cultural vulnerability for both societies. It is concluded, however, that the rich history of partnerships and collaborations between Jews and Palestinians provides a robust infrastructure on the basis of which a sustainable peace might be built, providing a much-needed source of hope.},

  abstract = {Phishing attacks aim to steal confidential information using sophisticated methods, techniques, and tools such as phishing through content injection, social engineering, online social networks, and mobile applications. To avoid and mitigate the risks of these attacks, several phishing detection approaches were developed, among which deep learning algorithms provided promising results. However, the results and the corresponding lessons learned are fragmented over many different studies and there is a lack of a systematic overview of the use of deep learning algorithms in phishing detection. Hence, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify, assess, and synthesize the results on deep learning approaches for phishing detection as reported by the selected scientific publications. We address nine research questions and provide an overview of how deep learning algorithms have been used for phishing detection from several aspects. In total, 43 journal articles were selected from electronic databases to derive the answers for the defined research questions. Our SLR study shows that except for one study, all the provided models applied supervised deep learning algorithms. The widely used data sources were URL-related data, third party information on the website, website content-related data, and email. The most used deep learning algorithms were deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks/long short-term memory networks. DNN and hybrid deep learning algorithms provided the best performance among other deep learning-based algorithms. 72% of the studies did not apply any feature selection algorithm to build the prediction model. PhishTank was the most used dataset among other datasets. While Keras and Tensorflow were the most preferred deep learning frameworks, 46% of the articles did not mention any framework. This study also highlights several challenges for phishing detection to pave the way for further research.},

abstract="In an increasingly digital world, we are continuously being met with novel and unprecedented challenges, the likes of which we have never encountered in our human history. Not only are we engaged in the balancing act of protecting individual and personal rights and freedoms with respect to both positive and negative rights, but we are also working to balance the interests of our communities, societies, and the greater global world in this novel forum. We have seen a growth in the desire for equality and equity for under-recognized and marginalised social groups, including the interest in indigenous rights and data sovereignty, as well as greater environmental accountability and transparency with regard to the inner workings of data centres and large technological infrastructure projects. Finally, we are seeing the fast-paced growth of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the corresponding concerns relating to human rights and ethics. These topics, and many more, are the ones which we will have to face as emerging topics in data sovereignty and digital governance in the months and years to come.",

  title = {How to Improve the Explanatory Power of an Intelligent Textbook: a Case Study in Legal Writing},
  year = {2024},
  journal = {International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education},
  abstract = {Explanatory processes are at the core of scientific investigation, legal reasoning, and education. However, effectively explaining complex or large amounts of information, such as that contained in a textbook or library, in an intuitive, user-centered way is still an open challenge. Indeed, different people may search for and request different types of information, even though texts typically have a predefined exposition and content. With this paper, we investigate how explanatory AI can better exploit the full potential of the vast and rich content library at our disposal. Based on a recent theory of explanations from Ordinary Language Philosophy, which frames the explanation process as illocutionary question-answering, we have developed a new type of interactive and adaptive textbook. Using the latest question-answering technology, our e-book software (YAI4Edu, for short) generates on-demand, expandable explanations that can help readers effectively explore teaching materials in a pedagogically productive way. It does this by extracting a specialized knowledge graph from a collection of books or other resources that helps identify the most relevant questions to be answered for a satisfactory explanation. We tested our technology with excerpts from a textbook that teaches how to write legal memoranda in the U.S. legal system. Then, to see whether YAI4Edu-enhanced textbooks are better than random and existing, general-purpose explanatory tools, we conducted a within-subjects user study with more than 100 English-speaking students. The students rated YAI4Edu’s explanations the highest. According to the students, the explanatory content generated by YAI4Edu is, on average, statistically better than two baseline alternatives (P values below .005).},

Given the lack of guidelines, policies, and resources to assist instructors in efficiently and ethically integrating AI into teaching and learning practices, this systematic review aimed to investigate AI integration competencies and challenges in higher education from the intelligent Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) perspective. We first applied the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to identify 23 studies published between 2019 and 2023 that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After conducting open coding and thematic analysis, the research findings showed four AI integration competencies and strategies, including 1) AI literacy and readiness as intelligent technological knowledge, 2) AI-supported innovative pedagogy to supplement instructor social presence and transform the instructor-student relationship, 3) AI as intelligent learning partners to increase student engagement in self-regulated learning and higher-order thinking skills, and 4) AI-driven learning experience design and delivery. AI integration limitations and challenges contained: 1) the short-term novelty effect, 2) digital divides, 3) technical deficiencies, and 4) ethical concerns. Based on the implications for future practices, a diagram was developed to illustrate the systematic considerations to support the sustainability of AI-assisted teaching and learning in higher education.},

  abstract = {Social Media has become a vital component of every individual's life in society opening a preferred spectrum of virtual communication which provides an individual with a freedom to express their views and thoughts. While virtual communication through social media platforms is highly desirable and has become an inevitable component, the dark side of social media is observed in form of detrimental/objectionable content. The reported detrimental contents are fake news, rumors, hate speech, aggressive, and cyberbullying which raise up as a major concern in the society. Such detrimental content is affecting person’s mental health and also resulted in loss which cannot be always recovered. So, detecting and moderating such content is a prime need of time. All social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube have made huge investments and also framed policies to detect and moderate such detrimental content. It is of paramount importance in the first place to detect such content. After successful detection, it should be moderated. With an overflowing increase in detrimental content on social media platforms, the current manual method to identify such content will never be enough. Manual and semi-automated moderation methods have reported limited success. A fully automated detection and moderation is a need of time to come up with the alarming detrimental content on social media. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has reached across all sectors and provided solutions to almost all problems, social media content detection and moderation is not an exception. So, AI-based methods like Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and Deep Neural Networks is rigorously deployed for detection and moderation of detrimental content on social media platforms. While detection of such content has been receiving good attention in the research community, moderation has received less attention. This research study spans into three parts wherein the first part emphasizes on the methods to detect the detrimental components using NLP. The second section describes about methods to moderate such content. The third part summarizes all observations to provide identified research gaps, unreported problems and provide research directions.},

abstract="This chapter discusses the scapegoat as the historical artifact lying at the base of judicial order through a close reading of two classic but `iconoclastic' Western films: John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) and Fred Zimmerman's High Noon (1951). What links these two otherwise very different films is their unusually frank treatment of the central legal paradox of the Western which might be called originary violence: in order for the community-within-the-wilderness to be established and for the rule of law to be created, a foundational murder must be committed. Originary violence is central to Girard's notion of the scapegoat---the product of the violent unanimity of the group directed against a designated enemy---as not just an abstract but as a temporally concrete phenomenon; it also corresponds closely to the friend-enemy distinction of Carl Schmitt's theory of constitutional law. Schmitt's notion of the decision, that precise moment in time at which the identity of the enemy is named, allows the community (the friends) to emerge. The word `decision' is etymologically derived from the Latin term Decidere, the initial incision into the body of the sacrificial victim; hence, the iconic plot of the Western---the war of the community against the outlaw---is dramatically identical to an act of scapegoating. The subversive genius of both films lies with their revealing of the sacrificial nature of the Western drama.",

However, its intrinsic vulnerability to cyber-attack becomes one of the biggest challenges since vehicles are no longer isolated. The intrusion detection approach draws much attention due to its simplicity and efficiency in protecting in-vehicle CAN bus. In this chapter, we first provide an introduction about how the in-vehicle network evolves. The critical role of CAN for current and future in-vehicle network is emphasized. Next, we describe intrusion detection approaches that exploit machine learning algorithms in detail. The introduction is taken from four aspects according to the domain knowledge of CAN used for intrusion detection methods, which are semantics-based methods, literal-based methods, timing-based methods, and signal characteristics-based methods respectively.",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in representation learning on graphs, facilitating various downstream tasks. However, GNNs have several drawbacks such as lacking interpretability, can easily inherit the bias of data and cannot model casual relations. Recently, counterfactual learning on graphs has shown promising results in alleviating these drawbacks. Various approaches have been proposed for counterfactual fairness, explainability, link prediction and other applications on graphs. To facilitate the development of this promising direction, in this survey, we categorize and comprehensively review papers on graph counterfactual learning. We divide existing methods into four categories based on problems studied. For each category, we provide background and motivating examples, a general framework summarizing existing works and a detailed review of these works. We point out promising future research directions at the intersection of graph-structured data, counterfactual learning, and real-world applications. To offer a comprehensive view of resources for future studies, we compile a collection of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. This survey aims to serve as a “one-stop-shop” for building a unified understanding of graph counterfactual learning categories and current resources.},

  abstract = {In these modern days, digital images become prominent information on the Internet and Social Media. The images can have a number of features with many secrets. To get these secrets, the information regarding the features of the images must be known. An image passes through the pre-processing stage before retrieving these features. For pre-processing, different operations such as normalization, thresholding, noise removal, etc. are applied to get the relevant features of the image. Feature extraction is the process of converting the input image into corresponding image features with the help of some algorithms such as the key point detector algorithm, edge detection algorithm, noise retrieval algorithm, etc. The objective of this survey article is to explore the latest methods for extracting image features and utilizing them in image forensics. These features are applied to detect the different types of image tampering attacks on the image with their detection techniques. Nowadays, the manipulation of an image is a very easy task with the help of different types of tools and software such as adobe photoshop, google picasa, and GNU’s Not Unix (GNU) Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), etc. To detect image tampering, features of the image play a very crucial role. A detailed review of different image features that are being utilized in image forensics has been done in the paper. The image features are colors, shape, texture, edges, noise, and key points. The different issues and challenges for detecting image tampering available with the existing techniques along with their performance have been presented in this paper. The future scope of the research work in the area of image processing has also been explored.},

  abstract = {Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems leverage information derived from sound waves produced by humans to identify the concealed emotions in utterances. Since 1996, researchers have placed effort on improving the accuracy of SER systems, their functionalities, and the diversity of emotions that can be identified by the system. Although SER systems have become very popular in a variety of domains in modern life and are highly connected to other systems and types of data, the security of SER systems has not been adequately explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of potential cyber-attacks aimed at SER systems and the security mechanisms that may prevent such attacks. To do so, we first describe the core principles of SER systems and discuss prior work performed in this area, which was mainly aimed at expanding and improving the existing capabilities of SER systems. Then, we present the SER system ecosystem, describing the dataflow and interactions between each component and entity within SER systems and explore their vulnerabilities, which might be exploited by attackers. Based on the vulnerabilities we identified within the ecosystem, we then review existing cyber-attacks from different domains and discuss their relevance to SER systems. We also introduce potential cyber-attacks targeting SER systems that have not been proposed before. Our analysis showed that only 30% of the attacks can be addressed by existing security mechanisms, leaving SER systems unprotected in the face of the other 70% of potential attacks. Therefore, we also describe various concrete directions that could be explored in order to improve the security of SER systems.},

abstract="Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in various applications, but what does it mean? AI is the ability of machines to replicate or enhance human intelligence, including logic and experience-based learning. One of the most intriguing and comprehensive fields of computer science, AI has a bright future. AI uses economics, probability theory, and algorithm design techniques to resolve real-world issues. AI also uses mathematics, psychology, languages, and computer science. While mathematics offers techniques for modeling and determining the resulting optimization problems, computer science provides tools for creating and putting algorithms into practice. The idea of AI had existed since the nineteenth century when Alan Turing proposed an ``imitation game'' to test machine intelligence. Still, it has only recently become feasible because of the growing accessibility of computing power and data to train AI systems. Modern computers fall well short of the biological neuronal network of the human body. However, they have one significant advantage over us: They are capable of processing enormous volumes of data and experiences at an unfathomably rapid rate. One of the many advantages and applications of AI is in cybersecurity. AI and machine learning can help to keep up with hackers, automate threat detection, and respond more effectively than conventional software-driven or manual operations considering today's quickly evolving cyberattacks and rapid gadget proliferation. This chapter aims to introduce artificial intelligence and cybersecurity to the industry.",

pages="339--364",
abstract="The Horatian dogma of ut pictura poesis positions itself at the interdisciplinary confluence not only of poetry and painting, but also, to a large extent, of rhetoric and aesthetics, epistemology and philosophy, cognition and other related social sciences. The theoretical discussion on the relationship of different media first emerged as a structural parallel that stressed kinship and harmony in Aristotelian poetics, and was then transformed into paragonal debates that emphasized difference and exceptionality during the Renaissance. Later, it arrived at an extreme delimitation of temporal and spatial arts, which deepened the historically empirical concern regarding philosophical and aesthetic fundamentals in the implications of binary opposition. Therefore, to sidestep the formal comparativity or time/space dichotomy as delineated from a genealogical approach, the notion of intermediality should be reformulated as a conceptual and ideological extension of ut pictura poesis. Its intermedial core shall be better understood on a theoretical basis of in-betweenness underpinned by a poststructuralist tendency. These both provide alternatives to the universality, radicalism, grand narrative, and fixed identity championed in the traditional literary and other art forms. Coming from the position of the in-between, intermediality has offered a series of new perspectives that transcend a limited point of view, cross the boundaries of stereotyped sections, decenter long-established authorities, link disconnected fragments, and search for revolutionary potentials. At the ultimate end, it creates a dynamic, fluid, and highly interactive communication that was scarce in the preexisting literary and art historiography.",

Malicious parties may modify or alter PCBs to purposely compromise the integrity of a design. In contrast, non-malicious incidents may also change an ideal design; they unintentionally lead to defects. For the reverse engineering process, which requires precise information to replicate a design, these deviations from the intended design present an overwhelming challenge. Although they are primarily unintentional, defects may cause a device to stray from its intended functionality, and present danger to both manufacturers and consumers. Therefore, irrespective of their cause and effect, the PCB inspection industry requires intricate knowledge of their occurrences; defects must be correctly enumerated before satisfactory solutions can be proposed. This article presents an extensive taxonomy of physical defects in PCBs that can be primarily identified using automated optical inspection (AOI), or traditional visual inspection methods where applicable. Our goal is to ultimately improve the state of hardware security by providing a guide to physical defects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive taxonomy of visual PCB defects.},

In ecosystems, keystone species are responsible for the stability and integrity of the ecological network, analogously to banks that may be too big to fail in an interconnected financial network. Essential genes and neural ensembles in the brain are crucial for integrating information in biological networks. Finding these influencers in a network is crucial to understanding the transference of information and the functionality and resilience of the system, as well as to learning about human behavior and biological function.

Based on a field study of digital nomadism, and accepting a pluralist approach to emancipation, we analyse the ‘emancipatory project(s)’ that digital nomads engage in. This analysis, following Weberian idealtypes, employs a tripartite structure: unsatisfactory conditions (what people want to overcome); emancipatory means (actions taken); and emancipatory ends (desired outcomes). We critically compare digital nomadism to the traditional descriptions of emancipatory projects in nation-state contexts, as found in prior literature, using the same analytical framework. Juxtaposing these idealtypes, we discuss similarities and differences and analyse their inherent assumptions, logics and ethical stances. We conclude that digital nomadism generates an emancipation that is very much ‘real’ for digital nomads, whose experience cannot be disregarded, but with a ‘postmodern’ ethos that is at odds with modernity and its ethos originating from the Enlightenment.},

After this, the food commons approach will be thoroughly defined. This part is divided into two main parts. First of all, the pars destruens of this doctrine will be taken into account, namely, its harsh critique of the contemporary postindustrial food system. Then the second part is devoted to describing the proactive proposals advanced by the food commons approach, which can be categorized under three main pillars: (1) a multidimensional and intrinsically political conception of food that rejects a monodimensional commodification of food and that nurtures instead various noncommodifiable dimensions (food as an essential life enabler, as a cultural and religious determinant, as a public good, as a human right, as a renewable natural resource, as a commodity, as a medicine, as a commons); (2) tricentric governance of food systems, where the food commons would balance and complement the other two traditional centers of power, represented by the public and the private sectors; and, eventually, (3) the reevaluation of food system actors, from mere passive consumers to food citizens constituting food democracy, i.e., as politically responsible individuals who collectively shape their food system according to more democratic, participative, and ecological mechanisms.",

In this review, we offer a systemic view on recent advancements in nanophotonic components designed by intelligence algorithms, manifesting a development trend from performance optimizations towards inverse creations of novel designs. To illustrate interplays between two fields, AI and photonics, we take meta-atom spectral manipulation as a case study to introduce algorithm operational principles, and subsequently review their manifold usages among a set of popular meta-elements. As arranged from levels of individual optimized piece to practical system, we discuss algorithm-assisted nanophotonic designs to examine their mutual benefits.

  abstract = {With the rapid development of the logistics industry and the continuous growth of e-commerce, effectively monitoring logistics warehouses has become increasingly important to ensure the security of goods and oversee activities within storage facilities. Although current surveillance systems provide a certain level of security for logistics warehouses, they still face issues such as data tampering, storage, and access management. These challenges can compromise the integrity of surveillance video data, making the system vulnerable to unauthorized access. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the implementation of blockchain-based security management and access control of video data in logistics warehouses. Specifically, the solution employs the Hyperledger Fabric consortium blockchain to execute smart contracts and store the hash values of video data, thereby detecting any tampering and enhancing the security and integrity of the data. Additionally, hybrid encryption technology is utilized to ensure the confidentiality of video data during transmission and storage. Furthermore, the solution leverages the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for distributed video storage. This not only increases the redundancy and accessibility of data storage but also reduces the risk of single-point failures. A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism is also introduced to strictly manage access permissions to video data, ensuring that only authorized users can access the data, thereby effectively preventing unauthorized access and data breaches. Through a comprehensive analysis of computational and communication costs and the evaluation of blockchain performance at 100 transactions per second for different transaction volumes using Hyperledger Caliper, the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Compared to current research, this solution exhibits higher security, providing a new approach for the secure management and access control of video data in logistics warehouses.},

Contrary to the existing literature, which commonly envisions RMDs as a unified framework, this article argues that Boix and Acemoglu and Robinson’s models should be understood as divergent theories of democratic transitions. In the aftermath of numerous criticisms, both authors have developed sharply different understandings of democratization. We argue that Acemoglu and Robinson have backtracked from their original formulation toward a “Whiggish” history of the rise of liberty, while Boix has increasingly reverted to the core propositions of classical modernization theory. In the process, this article argues that RMDs have lost, and reneged on, much of their apparent explanatory power regarding transitions to and reversions from democracy.},

Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind.},

A multitude of participants and a server cooperatively train a model without the need for data disclosure or collection. The healthcare industry, where security and privacy are paramount, can substantially benefit from this new learning paradigm, as data collection is no longer feasible due to stringent data policies. Nonetheless, unaddressed challenges and insufficient attack mitigation are hampering its adoption. Attack surfaces differ from traditional centralized learning in that the server and clients communicate between each round of training. In this paper, we thus present vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses based on the widened attack surfaces, as well as suggest promising new research directions toward a more robust FL.",

On the other hand, TAF industries contribute to approximately 20% of global pollution. The rise of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies—including the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and robotics—aims to enhance production efficiency and resource management. However, this transition brings several challenges, such as potential disruptions from automation, concerns regarding energy efficiency, and escalating sustainability demands. In response, Industry 5.0 (I5.0) emphasises the integration of human-centric and sustainable practices, encouraging collaboration between humans and machines. While some existing studies highlight the potential of these technologies as enablers of the circular economy (CE), they often fall short of comprehensively linking these technologies to specific operational and strategic elements of CE. Furthermore, they do not sufficiently address how these digital tools fit within a broader sustainability framework in the context of CE principles. This review study aims to explore how digital transformation through I4.0 and I5.0 technologies can enhance circular economy practices in the TAF industries while alleviating the environmental and social challenges associated with industrial growth. The study examined 42 peer-reviewed studies from 2013 to 2023, employing a descriptive and theoretical literature review methodology to analyse the strategies, impacts, and challenges of digitalisation and green transition in the TAF industries. Findings reveal a significant disparity between firms in the Global North, which focus on technology advancement, and those in the Global South, facing implementation barriers. The study advocates for an approach that contextualises the integration of I4.0 and I5.0 technologies, ensuring that sustainable production practices align with regional needs.},

The chapter re-evaluates the importance of confidence in financial markets, and it analyses the mechanisms behind its restoring process at the inception or in the aftermath of a financial crisis. Paradoxically confidence stands, simultaneously, as a synonym for certainty and uncertainty. Proclamations of confidence are frequently used as substitutes for substantive action. Within this fragile and delicate equilibrium in economics the chapter provides consolidating remarks and reveals the verisimilitude of the financial stage, namely that money does not have intrinsic value and that the financial system depends upon the plausibility of narratives of wealth and commerce performed by those best positioned to know those narratives: speculators and insiders.",

pages="1--26",
abstract="The Horatian dogma of ut pictura poesis positions itself at the interdisciplinary confluence not only of poetry and painting, but also, to a large extent, of rhetoric and aesthetics, epistemology and philosophy, cognition and other related social sciences. The theoretical discussion on the relationship of different media first emerged as a structural parallel that stressed kinship and harmony in Aristotelian poetics, and was then transformed into paragonal debates that emphasized difference and exceptionality during the Renaissance. Later, it arrived at an extreme delimitation of temporal and spatial arts, which deepened the historically empirical concern regarding philosophical and aesthetic fundamentals in the implications of binary opposition. Therefore, to sidestep the formal comparativity or time/space dichotomy as delineated from a genealogical approach, the notion of intermediality should be reformulated as a conceptual and ideological extension of ut pictura poesis. Its intermedial core shall be better understood on a theoretical basis of in-betweenness underpinned by a poststructuralist tendency. These both provide alternatives to the universality, radicalism, grand narrative, and fixed identity championed in the traditional literary and other art forms. Coming from the position of the in-between, intermediality has offered a series of new perspectives that transcend a limited point of view, cross the boundaries of stereotyped sections, decenter long-established authorities, link disconnected fragments, and search for revolutionary potentials. At the ultimate end, it creates a dynamic, fluid, and highly interactive communication that was scarce in the preexisting literary and art historiography.",

abstract="Cancer is a chronic disease where cells inside the body grow abnormally. It is a complicated disease with various molecular changes brought on by hereditary, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Human cancers for a long time avowed to be linked to genetic predisposition as well as causal environmental exposures. Cancers are most often recurring in many cases, implying that environmental factors are important in determining cancer risk. Multiple mutations in a lifetime, germline substitution in single nucleotide polymorphism, indel polymorphisms, and some constructional changes in chromosomes are all genomic causes of cancer. SNPs (Single nucleotide polymorphisms) act as biological markers and are evident in human DNA on gene promoter regions, coding DNA, non-coding DNA, and leader-trailer sequence making the 5{\textasciiacutex} and 3{\textasciiacutex} ends of untranslated regions. The different genomic elements in which any specific SNPs are situated determine the pathways for SNP-cancer interaction which is discussed in detail in this chapter. Moreover, it is being observed that external factors leading to changes in the genes owing to genetic code variations contribute to cancer risks concerning SNPs. Whole-genome SNP arrays are a helpful tool to uncover the association between SNPs and diseases like cancer, thanks to recent developments in high-throughput technologies. Computer intelligence-based machine learning approaches for handling classification problems can be used to predict cancer susceptibility models, gives reliable results for research and assessment. The approach studied in this chapter is to identify the mutations in genomic sequence that persists in the patients with cancer and forecast novel SNP-cancer interactions, to be used later for early detection with the help of computational intelligence. This discourse aims to give an all-inclusive overview of automated early diagnosis operations using SNP data and configure the future of cancer research.",

Technologies that support privacy, often by allowing to process data while limiting data access, are known as privacy-enhancing technologies. Examples of such technologies include anonymisation, federated learning or synthetic data generation. A very fundamental approach to implementing data protection is data protection by design, as required by the GDPR. This is based on the idea that data protection needs to be implemented in the development of systems from the start. Data protection needs to be integrated into the design of a system from the outset and across the entire life cycle, not as an issue that is implemented at the end through a data protection review and subsequent adaptation of the system.",

Thus, to preform, traditional static analysis requires advanced tool and an ever-increasing level of skill. Exploration of these various detection avoidance techniques as been included for understand of the issues encountered by security professionals, along with how improvements in software development methodologies and tooling has helped malware authors avoid detection, for little or no effort. This chapter explores the development of Deep Neural Networks in the defence against malware, looking specifically at how recent advances in Image Classification can be used detect and classify malware. As the Machine Learning industry seeks to make artificial intelligence and machine learning more accessible, through zero-code deep learning model training, this chapter will explore whether a zero-code approach to machine learning is feasible for developing deep neural network models for detecting and classifying malware. In particular the use of image classification models shall be explored, using off-the-self free or low-cost software, or cloud services.",

  abstract = {Steganography is one of the fascinating subjects for researchers. One of the recent research trends in this field is audio steganography, which depends on hiding of information in the cover file, while only the sender and the recipient know that there is a secret content. This technique achieves more information security and protects the image from unauthorized access. Based on the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), this paper provides a new audio steganography technique for concealing medical images in audio files. The medical image is encrypted using a Piece-Wise Linear Chaotic Map (PWLCM)-based bit-level image encryption technique. In addition, the image is processed as a spectrogram and converted into a speech-like signal through the STFT before embedding it within the cover audio file. The proposed technique is carried out on four different medical images, and four audio files of suitable size. Furthermore, it is validated by comparing it with the works in the literature. The comparison reveals that the proposed audio steganography technique reveals a superior performance regarding the quality of encryption and confidentiality of medical images, as the pre-stage with the PWLCM provides more security, and good restoration quality as it achieves a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 55.25 dB, and a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 2.9×10-6.},

Revealing the ``grammar'' of this language may be expected to lift modern biotechnology to a new level. At the same time, the concept of molecular language opens the door to a deeper understanding of the origin and early evolution of life. It is shown that linguistic pre-structures can already emerge in self-reproducing nucleic acids under prebiotic conditions. Accordingly, the first steps toward life must be regarded as a language-driven evolution of biological macromolecules that led to the protoforms of life. This phase of evolution was non-Darwinian, since it was driven exclusively by a natural selection of the phenotypic properties of nucleic acids. Only after the nucleation of the genetic code did molecular systems become the object of Darwinian evolution---that is, evolution by adaptation.",

  abstract = {Security represents one of the main critical issues in the Internet of Things (IoT), especially the routing attacks in the core network where the loss of information becomes very harmful. This paper proposes a novel scheme called deep learning-based early stage detection (DL-ESD) using IoT routing attack dataset (IRAD), including hello flood (HF), decreased rank (DR), and version number (VN) to enhance the detection capability of routing attacks. The experiments have been performed in three phases: (i) features extraction using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which aims to generate features more distinguishable from each other, (ii) the features normalization using min–max scaling to eliminate the worst overfittings to the existence of fewer data points in training samples, and (iii) selection the substantial features. The binary classification methods have been employed to measure the proposed model’s training efficiency. We have performed the training stage on deep learning techniques such as logistic regression (LR), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes (NB), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). The comparison results illustrate that the proposed MLP classifier has a high training accuracy and the best runtime rate. Consequently, the proposed scheme achieved prediction accuracy reaching 98.85%, precision of 97.50%, recall rate 98.33%, and 97.01% F1 score rate with better performance than state-of-the-art studies.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing demand to address failures in the fairness of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Current techniques for improving fairness in AI systems are focused on broad changes to the norms, procedures and algorithms used by companies that implement those systems. However, some organizations may require detailed methods to identify which user groups are disproportionately impacted by failures in specific components of their systems. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a popular safety engineering method and is proposed here as a vehicle to support the conducting of “AI fairness impact assessments” in organizations. An extension to FMEA called “FMEA-AI” is proposed as a modification to a familiar tool for engineers and manufacturers that can integrate moral sensitivity and ethical considerations into a company’s existing design process. Whereas current impact assessments focus on helping regulators identify an aggregate risk level for an entire AI system, FMEA-AI helps companies identify safety and fairness risk in multiple failure modes of an AI system. It also explicitly identifies user groups and considers an objective definition of fairness as proportional satisfaction of claims in calculating likelihood and severity of fairness-related failures. This proposed method can help industry analysts adapt a widely known safety engineering method to incorporate AI fairness considerations, promote moral sensitivity and overcome resistance to change.},

abstract="I believe social reality to exist with objective content independent of the human mind, and to exist as a multiplicity of beings: the variety of ways that nature is differentiated into and can be identified, perceptible to the human mind as representations of different things in themselves (i.e. chair, table, earth, human, cat, plane, sea, etc.). This viewpoint aligns with `dialectical materialism' or realist ontology, which accords primacy to content and being over form (i.e. the ideal) and thought (Kipfer, 2009). Dialectical materialist ontology is encapsulated in the concept of ``social formation'' by Marx and Engels, who argue that ``consciousness can never be anything else than conscious being'' (Marx and Engels, 1998, pp. 36--37). The `form' of individuals in the process of becoming a conscious being is determined, among others, by their production, which not only entails physical production and reproduction, but also a definite form of expressing life on an individual's part. The human, in this view, is the empirically perceptible grounds of social reality, rather than being an ideal or a subjectively constructed phenomenon in an abstract rigidity (as with the dead facts in the case of empiricists or the imagined subjects of the idealist). This ontology views social reality as amenable to empirical research through sense experience and observation (for a discussion on the distinction between this and other approaches to social inquiry, positivism, empiricism and rationalism, see May, 2011, and Markie, 2017).",

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant progress in image-based 3D face reconstruction using deep convolutional neural networks. However, current reconstruction methods often perform improperly in self-occluded regions and can lead to inaccurate correspondences between a 2D input image and a 3D face template, hindering use in real applications. To address these problems, we propose a deep shape reconstruction and texture completion network, SRTC-Net, which jointly reconstructs 3D facial geometry and completes texture with correspondences from a single input face image. In SRTC-Net, we leverage the geometric cues from completed 3D texture to reconstruct detailed structures of 3D shapes. The SRTC-Net pipeline has three stages. The first introduces a correspondence network to identify pixel-wise correspondence between the input 2D image and a 3D template model, and transfers the input 2D image to a U-V texture map. Then we complete the invisible and occluded areas in the U-V texture map using an inpainting network. To get the 3D facial geometries, we predict coarse shape (U-V position maps) from the segmented face from the correspondence network using a shape network, and then refine the 3D coarse shape by regressing the U-V displacement map from the completed U-V texture map in a pixel-to-pixel way. We examine our methods on 3D reconstruction tasks as well as face frontalization and pose invariant face recognition tasks, using both in-the-lab datasets (MICC, MultiPIE) and in-the-wild datasets (CFP). The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on inferring 3D facial geometry and complete texture; they outperform or are comparable to the state-of-the-art.},

More recently, text-guided 3D editing that modifies 3D assets guided by text prompts is user-friendly and practical, which evokes a surge in research within this field. In this survey, we comprehensively investigate recent literature on text-guided 3D editing in an attempt to answer two questions: What are the methodologies of existing text-guided 3D editing? How has current progress in text-guided 3D editing gone so far? Specifically, we focus on text-guided 3D editing methods published in the past 4 years, delving deeply into their frameworks and principles. We then present a fundamental taxonomy in terms of the editing strategy, optimization scheme, and 3D representation. Based on the taxonomy, we review recent advances in this field, considering factors such as editing scale, type, granularity, and perspective. In addition, we highlight four applications of text-guided 3D editing, including texturing, style transfer, local editing of scenes, and insertion editing, to exploit further the 3D editing capacities with in-depth comparisons and discussions. Depending on the insights achieved by this survey, we discuss open challenges and future research directions. We hope this survey will help readers gain a deeper understanding of this exciting field and foster further advancements in text-guided 3D editing.},

Blockchain databases have been proposed by the community to alleviate these challenges, however existing blockchain architectures suffer from performance issues. In this paper we introduce Triabase, a novel permissioned blockchain system architecture that applies data decaying concepts to cope with scalability issues in regards to blockchain consensus and storage efficiency. For blockchain consensus, we propose the Proof of Federated Learning (PoFL) algorithm which exploits data decaying models as Proof-of-Work. For storage efficiency, we exploit federated learning to construct data postdiction machine learning models to minimize the storage of bulky data on the blockchain. We present a detailed explanation of our system architecture as well as the implementation in the Hyperledger fabric framework. We use our implementation to carry out an experimental evaluation with telco big data at scale showing that our framework exposes desirable qualities, namely efficient consensus at the blockchain layer while optimizing storage efficiency.},

The study is, first of all, a study of the coordinative practices of a cooperative ensemble of operators controlling a time-critical transformation process, while spatially dispersed at different work stations across the plant, working under quite different and varying local constraints and requirements, with only rudimentary means of ongoing communication. Their individual and local contributions to the overall effort must be minutely synchronized to meet the strict temporal requirements of the operation as a whole. These challenges notwithstanding, the operators manage to act concertedly to produce quality steel and to do so routinely. The question is, how do they manage to do that? As the workers in the setting generally are not able to coordinate their cooperative effort discursively, it is analytically both feasible and necessary to foreground and identify the knowledge of metallurgy of steel and of the plant that enables them, as they go about their own local activities, to apprehend the problems and intentions of their colleagues as reflected in the changing state of the technical processes. The underlying thesis of the study is that in order to answer the general question of how workers engaged in cooperative work are able to heed the activities of their colleagues, and to do so routinely, we are well advised to ‘take the concept of practice seriously’.},

abstract="This chapter summarizes the game theoretical strategies for generating adversarial manipulations. The adversarial learning objective for our adversaries is assumed to be to inject small changes into the data distributions, defined over positive and negative class labels, to the extent that deep learning subsequently misclassifies the data distribution. Thus, the theoretical goal of our adversarial deep learning process becomes one of determining whether a manipulation of the input data has reached a learner decision boundary, i.e., where too many positive labels have become negative labels. The adversarial data is generated by solving for optimal attack policies in Stackelberg games where adversaries target the misclassification performance of deep learning. Sequential game theoretical formulations can model the interaction between an intelligent adversary and a deep learning model to generate adversarial manipulations by solving a two-player sequential non-cooperative Stackelberg game where each player's payoff function increases with interactions to a local optimum. With a stochastic game theoretical formulation, we can then extend the two-player Stackelberg game into a multiplayer Stackelberg game with stochastic payoff functions for the adversaries. Both versions of the game are resolved through the Nash equilibrium, which refers to a pair of strategies in which there is no incentive for either the learner or the adversary to deviate from their optimal strategy. We can then explore adversaries who optimize variational payoff functions via data randomization strategies on deep learning designed for multi-label classification tasks. Similarly, the outcome of these investigations is an algorithm design that solves a variable-sum two-player sequential Stackelberg game with new Nash equilibria. The adversary manipulates variational parameters in the input data to mislead the learning process of the deep learning, so it misclassifies the original class labels as the targeted class labels. The ideal variational adversarial manipulation is the minimum change needed to the adversarial cost function of encoded data that will result in the deep learning incorrectly labeling the decoded data. The optimal manipulations are due to stochastic optima in non-convex best response strategies. The adversarial data generated by this variant of the Stackelberg games simulates continuous interactions with the classifier's learning processes as opposed to one-time interactions. The learning process of the CNNs can be manipulated by an adversary at the input data level as well as the generated data level. We can then retrain the original deep learning model on the manipulated data to give rise to a secure adversarial deep learning model that is robust to subsequent performance vulnerabilities from game theoretical adversaries. Alternative hypotheses for such adversarial data mining in the game theoretical adversarial deep learning strategies are provided in cybersecurity applications with machine learning that is designed for security requirements. The game theoretical solution concepts lead to a deep neural network that is robust to subsequent data manipulation by a game theoretical adversary. This promising result suggests that learning algorithms based on game theoretical modeling and mathematical optimization are a significantly better approach to building more secure deep learning models.",

abstract="Each information system (IS) has an underlying architecture, although its complexity and scope can vary quite substantially for different kinds of systems. Since design decisions about the architecture define the very foundation of an IS, these design decisions cannot be easily undone or altered after they were made. If not taken seriously enough, improper IS architecture designs can result in the development of systems that are incapable of adequately meeting user requirements. Understanding the concept of good IS architecture design and taking design decisions diligently is, therefore, highly important for an IS development project's success. In order to answer the question of what constitutes a good IS architecture, this chapter examines the importance of design decisions across a system's lifecycle. In particular, two different perspectives on the concept of good IS architecture design are explicated: (1) design as a process and (2) design as the outcome of a design process. The two perspectives are closely related to each other and generally help explain the more abstract concept of IS architecture design and particularly the characteristics of a good IS architecture.",

abstract="The combinatorial nature of DNA-Encoded Libraries (DEL) creates a vast number of compounds covering a wide range of chemistry space, enabling DEL target selections for possible binders that generate enormous amounts of data. This makes advanced cheminformatics and data analysis approaches indispensable for advancing DEL technology for practical applications in the pharmaceutical industry. When designed DEL libraries can be biased to contain compounds with more drug like features through the enumeration of the potential virtual products, based on their combinatorial assembly from available building blocks, and the calculation of molecular descriptors. Computational approaches are also critical in analyzing selection data. In a DEL target selection, it is essential to apply stringent analysis methods to the raw sequencing data to separate real hits from noise and to mitigate the amount of resource required for off-DNA synthesis for hit confirmation. In this chapter we focus on the important role of cheminformatics and computational analysis at all phases of the DEL hit identification workflow by discussing in detail DEL product enumeration, designing DELs of diverse products with focused in specific property spaces, estimating data noise levels in DEL selections, and the process of DEL selection data triage and analysis that eventually identifies hits for on- and off-DNA synthesis. We also outline perspectives of emerging cheminformatics methods for DELs that could further strengthen the technology to facilitate hit identification processes and improve the hit confirmation rate. Emerging methods such as efficient structure searching, visualizing DEL chemistry space, and potential machine learning applications for DEL selection analysis are discussed.",

  year = {2024},
  journal = {Annals of Operations Research},
  abstract = {The pandemic and a series of subsequent disruptive events fully exposed the vulnerability of supply chains. Research in the field of resilience in supply chain risk management has recorded significant interest across a wide range of academic disciplines. Therefore, there is a need to synthesize, categorize and explain existing and newly emerging research directions, which may represent relevant platforms for developing supply chain concepts in the future. This study addresses this need by providing a bibliometric review of published papers on resilience in supply chain risk management. By analyzing more than 2500 published papers through bibliometric and machine-learning-based methods, we identified ten topics related to risk and resilience of supply chains: Pandemic impacts of food supply chain; Practices for capability and performance; Supplier-related modeling and optimization; System security and critical infrastructure; Production changes; IT in manufacturing process; Sustainability in global economy; Management and business approach; Modeling and design of complex networks; Operational strategies for risk mitigation. By analyzing articles published since 2020, we also identified a change in the direction of research dedicated to supply chain risk and resilience; we identified three other topics that were not recognized as distinct topics prior to 2020—Operational management; strategy; Sustainable production. The results of this study help in understanding the change in the direction of research in the area of risk and resilience of supply chains and thus provide up-to-date information for further research in this dynamically developing area.},

  abstract = {Autism screening is crucial for the early diagnosis of developmental disorder. The combination of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches are applied to produce memory efficient and less complex deep learning models for the computer aided diagnosis (CAD) of autism screening. In the proposed work, two novel integrated activation functions such as Li-ReLU and S-RReLU are developed to aid in the classification of autistic subjects and typical controls (TC) with maximum accuracy. As functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is noisy, it undergoes temporal and spatial pre-processing. The artifact free high dimensional fMRI data is exercised for the process of feature extraction and dimensionality reduction employing group principal component analysis (Group PCA) and group independent component analysis (Group ICA). The selected features are normalized using 0–1 normalization and converted to tensors. Stacked autoencoder (SAE) utilizes the fMRI tensor data for the classification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects and typical controls. The proposed work is implemented and tested on all datasets of ABIDE I database. The validation accuracy of CMU_a, KKI, UCLA_2, OLIN, Yale and NYU datasets are obtained as 100, 80, 71.43, 100, 85.71 and 93.33% using novel Li-ReLU activation function in the proposed system. With the help of new activation function called S-RReLU, the proposed system achieves validation accuracy of about 10, 100, 57.14, 100, 78.57 and 93.33% for CMU_a, KKI, UCLA_2, OLIN, Yale and NYU datasets.

  journal = {International Journal of Computer Vision},
  pages = {1650-1674},
  abstract = {Perception of content and structure in images with rainstreaks or raindrops is challenging, and it often calls for robust deraining algorithms to remove the diversified rainy effects. Much progress has been made on the design of advanced encoder–decoder single image deraining networks. However, most of the existing networks are built in a blind manner and often produce over/under-deraining artefacts. In this paper, we point out, for the first time, that the unsatisfactory results are caused by the highly imbalanced distribution between rainy effects and varied background scenes. Ignoring this phenomenon results in the representation learned by the encoder being biased towards rainy regions, while paying less attention to the valuable contextual regions. To resolve this, a context-enhanced representation learning and deraining network is proposed with a novel two-branch encoder design. Specifically, one branch takes the rainy image directly as input for learning a mixed representation depicting the variation of both rainy regions and contextual regions, and another branch is guided by a carefully learned soft attention mask to learn an embedding only depicting the contextual regions. By combining the embeddings from these two branches with a carefully designed co-occurrence modelling module, and then improving the semantic property of the co-occurrence features via a bi-directional attention layer, the underlying imbalanced learning problem is resolved. Extensive experiments are carried out for removing rainstreaks and raindrops from both synthetic and real rainy images, and the proposed model is demonstrated to produce significantly better results than state-of-the-art models. In addition, comprehensive ablation studies are also performed to analyze the contributions of different designs. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available at https://github.com/RobinCSIRO/CERLD-Net.git.},

  number = {2},
  journal = {Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems},
  pages = {62},
  abstract = {To aid humans in everyday tasks, robots need to know which objects exist in the scene, where they are, and how to grasp and manipulate them in different situations. Therefore, object recognition and grasping are two key functionalities for autonomous robots. Most state-of-the-art approaches treat object recognition and grasping as two separate problems, even though both use visual input. Furthermore, the knowledge of the robot is fixed after the training phase. In such cases, if the robot encounters new object categories, it must be retrained to incorporate new information without catastrophic forgetting. To resolve this problem, we propose a deep learning architecture with an augmented memory capacity to handle open-ended object recognition and grasping simultaneously. In particular, our approach takes multi-views of an object as input and jointly estimates pixel-wise grasp configuration as well as a deep scale- and rotation-invariant representation as output. The obtained representation is then used for open-ended object recognition through a meta-active learning technique. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to grasp never-seen-before objects and to rapidly learn new object categories using very few examples on-site in both simulation and real-world settings. Our approach empowers a robot to acquire knowledge about new object categories using, on average, less than five instances per category and achieve $$95\%$$object recognition accuracy and above $$91\%$$grasp success rate on (highly) cluttered scenarios in both simulation and real-robot experiments.

As a result, image credibility verification approaches are constantly gaining popularity due to their importance in a variety of social concerns, including the government, military, forensics, and electronic commerce, among others. Even a minor attack could have disastrous consequences. Therefore, protecting images from tampering has become increasingly crucial. Many approaches have been developed in the literature to ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital images. These methodologies can be grouped into active and passive approaches for image authentication and tampering detection. Active image authentication has a general solution based on watermarking, signature and hybrid techniques. Passive authentication, on the other hand, relies on the image’s inherent natural characteristics to provide implicit authentication. Digital image forensic tools have been utilized for identifying the signs of digital tampering. We have found from the literature of the past three decades that image credibility verification approaches have achieved promising results. However, accurate image tamper localization remains an unsolved problem and a fairly difficult task too, if it is performed carefully with expertise. This motivated us to present a comprehensive review of image authentication techniques, which enables not only image tamper detection but also localize the manipulated region. We also discussed the future work.},

Challenges to normative planning and urban design models after World War II led to three specific challenges: incorporation of new models of complexity into urban understanding, theories of the traditional city, the non-plan within architecture, and the rejection of the ``concept'' in the fine arts and political theory. The vestiges of these debates have only recently been accounted for in architecture, as the profession tends to maintain its disciplinary language, making it indifferent to forces impacting a large sector of the world population.

Nevertheless, the use of these applications in sensitive clinical domains where high-stakes decisions are involved could be much more extensive if patients, medical professionals, and regulators were provided with mechanisms for trusting the results provided by AI systems. A key issue for achieving this is endowing AI systems with key dimensions of Trustworthy AI (TAI), such as fairness, transparency, robustness, or accountability, which are not usually considered within this context in a generalized and systematic manner. This paper reviews the recent advances in the TAI domain, including TAI standards and guidelines. We propose several requirements to be addressed in the design, development, and deployment of TAI systems and present a novel machine learning pipeline that contains TAI requirements as embedded components. Moreover, as an example of how current AI systems in medicine consider the TAI perspective, the study extensively reviews the recent literature (2017–2021) on AI systems in a prevalent and high social-impact disease: diagnosis and progression detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). The most relevant AI systems in the AD domain are compared and discussed (such as machine learning, deep learning, ensembles, time series, and multimodal multitask) from the perspective of how they address TAI in their design. Several open challenges are highlighted, which could be claimed as one of the main reasons to justify the rare application of AI systems in real clinical environments. The study provides a roadmap to measure the TAI status of an AI systems and highlights its limitations. In addition, it provides the main guidelines to overcome these limitations and build medically trusted AI-based applications in the medical domain.},

It does so by considering what building an agile yet robust anticipatory governance regulatory culture involves. It systematically excavates a variety of tools and elements that are being put to use in inventive ways and argues that these need to be more cohesively and systemically integrated into jurisdictions’ regulatory toolbox. Approaches covered include strategic foresight, the critical embrace of iterative policy development and regulatory learning in the face of uncertainty, and the embrace of bottom-up approaches to co-creation of policy such as policy labs and the testing and regulatory learning through pilot regulation and experimentation. The growing use of regulatory sandboxes as an EU policy tool to boost innovation and navigate regulatory complexity, as seen in the EU AI Act, is also probed.},

It finds Turkey's responses (through the public school curriculum and a supplementary social cohesion strategy, such as permitting work permits, free movement, and language skill development), contrasts Bangladesh's (Rohingya camp confinement, playground, ballgame, and landscape changes), substantively, raising questions if disparate local findings can still belong to the same theoretical (or universal) cluster. Invoking Freire's critical pedagogical premises is balanced by accessing rationally structured education, particularly for Rohingyas and Syrians. Such findings prompt an exploration of best refugee camp education practices, and how rational practices (of refugees, their children and the stakeholders) relate with emancipation under critical conscience. The study exposes how local mind functions (idiosyncrasies) bounce off global walls.",

  abstract = {As an emerging technology in the era of Industry 4.0, digital twin is gaining unprecedented attention because of its promise to further optimize process design, quality control, health monitoring, decision and policy making, and more, by comprehensively modeling the physical world as a group of interconnected digital models. In a two-part series of papers, we examine the fundamental role of different modeling techniques, twinning enabling technologies, and uncertainty quantification and optimization methods commonly used in digital twins. This first paper presents a thorough literature review of digital twin trends across many disciplines currently pursuing this area of research. Then, digital twin modeling and twinning enabling technologies are further analyzed by classifying them into two main categories: physical-to-virtual, and virtual-to-physical, based on the direction in which data flows. Finally, this paper provides perspectives on the trajectory of digital twin technology over the next decade, and introduces a few emerging areas of research which will likely be of great use in future digital twin research. In part two of this review, the role of uncertainty quantification and optimization are discussed, a battery digital twin is demonstrated, and more perspectives on the future of digital twin are shared. Code and preprocessed data for generating all the results and figures presented in the battery digital twin case study in part 2 of this review are available on Github.},

  abstract = {Phishing is an attack targeting to imitate the official websites of corporations such as banks, e-commerce, financial institutions, and governmental institutions. Phishing websites aim to access and retrieve users’ important information such as personal identification, social security number, password, e-mail, credit card, and other account information. Several anti-phishing techniques have been developed to cope with the increasing number of phishing attacks so far. Machine learning and particularly, deep learning algorithms are nowadays the most crucial techniques used to detect and prevent phishing attacks because of their strong learning abilities on massive datasets and their state-of-the-art results in many classification problems. Previously, two types of feature extraction techniques [i.e., character embedding-based and manual natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction] were used in isolation. However, researchers did not consolidate these features and therefore, the performance was not remarkable. Unlike previous works, our study presented an approach that utilizes both feature extraction techniques. We discussed how to combine these feature extraction techniques to fully utilize from the available data. This paper proposes hybrid deep learning models based on long short-term memory and deep neural network algorithms for detecting phishing uniform resource locator and evaluates the performance of the models on phishing datasets. The proposed hybrid deep learning models utilize both character embedding and NLP features, thereby simultaneously exploiting deep connections between characters and revealing NLP-based high-level connections. Experimental results showed that the proposed models achieve superior performance than the other phishing detection models in terms of accuracy metric.},

  pages = {1971-2005},
  abstract = {State-of-the-art music recommender systems are based on collaborative filtering, which builds upon learning similarities between users and songs from the available listening data. These approaches inherently face the cold-start problem, as they cannot recommend novel songs with no listening history. Content-aware recommendation addresses this issue by incorporating content information about the songs on top of collaborative filtering. However, methods falling in this category rely on a shallow user/item interaction that originates from a matrix factorization framework. In this work, we introduce neural content-aware collaborative filtering, a unified framework which alleviates these limits, and extends the recently introduced neural collaborative filtering to its content-aware counterpart. This model leverages deep learning for both extracting content information from low-level acoustic features and for modeling the interaction between users and songs embeddings. The deep content feature extractor can either directly predict the item embedding, or serve as a regularization prior, yielding two variants (strict and relaxed) of our model. Experimental results show that the proposed method reaches state-of-the-art results for both warm- and cold-start music recommendation tasks. We notably observe that exploiting deep neural networks for learning refined user/item interactions outperforms approaches using a more simple interaction model in a content-aware framework.},

abstract="For those interested in human behavior, developmental science is an essential body of knowledge. The first 3 years of life is a period of rapid change across all domains of development, with the importance of experiences during this initial postnatal window increasingly well documented. The chapter begins by considering theories of development, which address the content of development, and models of development, which address the process of development. The importance of culture as a central context defining the meaning of child and parenting behavior and assigning value to beliefs and practices will be emphasized. The conceptual framework employed describes 3 periods of major qualitative changes in the first 3 years of life. These biobehavioral shifts, occurring roughly at 2--3 months, 7--9 months, and 18--20 months, are periods in which new capacities and behaviors emerge that have not been apparent earlier. The development of the domains of biological-neurological, emotional, social, communicative, and cognitive development are described within each of the 4 periods that these 3 biobehavioral shifts demarcate. The chapter concludes with a discussion of risk and protective factors that influence developmental trajectories of young children. The main, mediating, and moderating effects of risk and protective factors and mechanisms have enormous implications for our understanding of psychopathological processes and their prevention and treatment.",

Drones are now equipped with cameras that are used to measure the progress of construction works and monitor assets for structural defects. Simultaneously, our cities are increasingly filled with various sensors that extract data from our digital trails, accelerating the datafication of our urban environment. This chapter outlines the broad themes of the book, exploring the impact of technologies of automation on the city in three ways: the automation of the design process to provide optimised solutions to design problems. Second, the automation of construction processes and building maintenance programmes, including advances on how we collect and analyse sensor data. Third, how technologies of automation could potentially impact our way of life in cities, such as how we expand our cities, how we manufacture and fabricate what we need and want, how we utilise urban data to navigate around a city to transport people and goods, or use urban data to make trusted decisions about a city.",

abstract="Structuring control flow is an essential task almost every programmer faces on a daily basis. At the same time, the control flow of software applications is becoming increasingly complicated, motivating languages to include more and more features like asynchronous programming and generators. Effect handlers are a promising alternative since they can express many of these features as libraries. To bring effect handlers closer to the software engineering practice, we present capability passing as an implementation technique for effect handlers. Capability passing provides the basis for the integration of effect handlers into mainstream object-oriented programming languages and thereby unlocks novel modularization strategies. It also enables programmers to apply lexical reasoning about effects and gives rise to a new form of effect polymorphism. Finally, it paves the path for efficient compilation strategies of control effects.",

The moral panic surrounding protecting young people’s perceived ‘innocence’ from a real or perceived ‘sexual threat’ has generated increasingly harsher legal limitations on their sexual expression and assertion of sexual agency, desire and rights related to bodily autonomy. In response, some child rights’ groups, women’s rights groups, feminist scholars and lawyers are raising concerns about how increasingly punitive approaches to addressing gender-based harms and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) violations faced by young people may have a collateral impact on their right to bodily autonomy. These restrictive and often punitive measures are generally promoted as protective, and in some cases, they are legitimately so. In our analysis, they also may amount to ‘protectionism’, a form of penalisation that, in effect, criminalises’ young peoples’ exploration of their gender, sexuality, bodies and pleasure. Protectionist approaches are often ideologically driven and based on paternalistic assumptions about young peoples’ (and especially girls’ and young women’s) capacity and ability, with the pretence of protecting those defined as ‘weak’ or ‘vulnerable’ as if these are inherent to the individual rather than structurally and socially constituted. It is this penalisation and alternatives to it that we explore here.},

Firstly, we analysed 45 content sharing platforms where aggressors might post non-consensual pornography. The analysis identified three distinct interaction styles for reporting the crime: Scriptum (a text-field where the user verbally describes the abuse), Bonam (a multilayered menu that includes a correct option), and Malam (a multilayered menu that does not include a correct option). Secondly, we conducted a within-subject study to evaluate the experience elicited by these interaction styles. Participants (N = 39) were given a scenario and asked to report six blurred images as non-consensual pornography using a medium-fidelity prototype. The results exposed complex trade-offs between clarity, efficiency, and distress among the different interaction styles. These trade-offs open foundational research directions transcending boundaries between human-computer interaction and multimedia studies and interfacing computer science research with the law.},

abstract="The purpose of this chapter is to give a detailed definition and analysis of the mediation process so as to gain in-depth insight into how mediation could be applied in the sovereign debt dispute context. Accordingly, this chapter reviews past and present definitions of mediation before suggesting a working definition in the context of sovereign debt mediations. It then goes on to distinguish mediation from the seemingly similar but different settlement technique of conciliation, which is well-anchored in the investor-state domain but which has had only limited success to date. Thereafter, the chapter sheds light on the different phases of the mediation process, their purpose and how they are organized. It also describes the training and techniques mediators use to help parties agree on settlement terms. Mediators' techniques are focused on a negotiated outcome based on the parties' interests, as opposed to imposing an outcome based solely on the parties' legal positions. Such mediation techniques can lead to more efficient outcomes. Moreover, reflecting the divergent needs that might arise depending on the parties' characteristics or the circumstances surrounding the dispute, this chapter also describes the multitude of mediation styles that have developed to cater to those specific needs and describes the various criteria that the parties or the mediator can use to select the most appropriate style to resolve their dispute. In addition to having the possibility of selecting from various mediation styles, this chapter also posits that parties may also resort to blended styles of mediation involving a combination of mediation and arbitration, which might be useful where the circumstances are not ripe for mediation or where different aspects of the dispute require different dispute resolution mechanisms. Subsequently, this chapter turns to the underlying legal framework on both a domestic and international level for mediation with regards to how parties are compelled to mediate, what procedural and ethical safeguards are put in place for the proceedings and the legal effect of an eventual settlement agreement. Most importantly, with respect to the investor-state context, this chapter also describes the Singapore Convention which grants certain mediated agreements the status of an enforceable, final judgment and the potential of the Singapore Convention to apply to sovereign debt disputes and the benefits thereof.",

In the case of the socio-cultural universe, modern evolutionary theory is relevant for some explanations, but not to the degree assumed by socio-biology, evolutionary psychology, and even co-evolutionary models. The program proposed is built around social network theory, cladistic analysis, and comparative neuro-anatomy, and outlines where biological analysis is appropriate and useful. An understanding of the biological basis of human behavior will allow sociologists to develop theoretical approaches to explaining the emergent properties of the socio-cultural universe.

abstract="Digital transformation is a global phenomenon, capturing the attention in every industry and spurring major investment. However, digital transformation is not a single objective; it is a multifaceted approach depending on the goals of the respective industry and digital maturity. Thus, digital transformation is the way of change from a monolithic business approach to fully digitized business concepts. Therefore, Chap. 1introduces us to relevant definitions on digital transformation and their main technological background. One major concern in digital transformation is the confluence of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Analytics, Blockchain, Cloud Computing and Services, Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things, and others. In this regard, Cloud Computing and Services achieve a new generation of Artificial Intelligence, applied in an increasing number of industrial applications with unprecedented results. Besides this, the Internet of Things connects industrial devices and entities within industrial value chains and infrastructure, however, generating terabytes of data every day, which requires Big Data and Analytics to deal with them. Therefore, the digital transformation has a huge impact on industrial control systems and processes, as well as on the Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Moreover, emerging technologies also will have a huge impact on the realization of circular economy in the industrial sectors, a paradigm in today's digital transformation in industrial, public, and private discussion to reduce the greenhouse effect. Against this background, digital transformation has received a great attention in all industrial, public, and private organizations, which will be fundamentally changing operational business approaches in all sectors. Hence, the transformation of organizations through digitization and emerging technologies can be referred to as a technological wave, such as the third and now the fourth industrial transformation. In this context, the fourth industrial transformation optimizes computerization of the third through digitization, wireless infrastructure networks, intelligent algorithms, and others, which today is known as digital transformation paradigm. Thus, digitization and technologies in digital transformation create, and consequently change, market offerings, business processes, or business models, which result from the use of both. However, the intrinsic complexity of digital transformation also makes cybersecurity awareness a sine qua non. Cybersecurity deals with the presence of cyber attackers with their cybercriminal attack repertoire. Cybercrime causes {\$} 100 billion and more in damage annually, which means cybercriminal attack prevention has a clear need to address it. However, cybersecurity spans many areas, including, but not limited to, data security, information security, operational security, and others. Moreover, cybersecurity is fundamental to both protecting secret data and information and enabling their defense. Therefore, cybersecurity is understood as a body of knowledge with regard to technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect computer systems, networks, infrastructure resources, and others, from cyber-criminal attacks, damage, manipulation, or unauthorized access. In this context, Chap. 1introduce in Sect. 1.1 into the manifold aspects of digital transformation with their great impact on industrial, public, and private organizations development, enhancing their business success. Section 1.2 focusses on emerging technologies required and used in digital transformation, presented in twenty Subsections. Against this background, Section 1.3 discusses the challenges of digital transformation in industrial businesses, while Sect. 1.4 introduces applications in digital transformation. Section 1.5 answers the question how to become a leader in digital transformation. Section 1.6 introduces the topic cybersecurity, taking into account knowledge about the interaction of digitization and emerging technologies to gain knowledge about cybersecurity risks through threat event attacks. In this sense, Section 1.6 also focusses on the CIA Triad and the actionable knowledge in cybersecurity that is still paramount. Finally, Section 1.7 describes the challenges of digital transformation to build up a circular economy. Section 1.8 contains comprehensive questions from the topics digital transformation, cybersecurity, and circular economy, followed by references for further reading section.",

  abstract = {The continuous development in Automatic Speech Recognition has grown and demonstrated its enormous potential in Human Interaction Communication systems. It is quite a challenging task to achieve high accuracy due to several parameters such as different dialects, spontaneous speech, speaker’s enrolment, computation power, dataset, and noisy environment that decrease the performance of the speech recognition system. It has motivated various researchers to make innovative contributions to the development of a robust speech recognition system. The study presents a systematic analysis of current state-of-the-art research work done in this field during 2015-2021. The prime focus of the study is to highlight the neural network-based speech recognition techniques, datasets, toolkits, and evaluation metrics utilized in the past seven years. It also synthesizes the evidence from past studies to provide empirical solutions for accuracy improvement. This study highlights the current status of speech recognition systems using neural networks and provides a brief knowledge to the new researchers.},

  journal = {Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence},
  abstract = {Algorithmic design in neural architecture search (NAS) has received a lot of attention, aiming to improve performance and reduce computational cost. Despite the great advances made, few authors have proposed to tailor initialization techniques for NAS. However, the literature shows that a good initial set of solutions facilitates finding the optima. Therefore, in this study, we propose a data-driven technique to initialize a population-based NAS algorithm. First, we perform a calibrated clustering analysis of the search space, and second, we extract the centroids and use them to initialize a NAS algorithm. We benchmark our proposed approach against random and Latin hypercube sampling initialization using three population-based algorithms, namely a genetic algorithm, an evolutionary algorithm, and aging evolution, on CIFAR-10. More specifically, we use NAS-Bench-101 to leverage the availability of NAS benchmarks. The results show that compared to random and Latin hypercube sampling, the proposed initialization technique enables achieving significant long-term improvements for two of the search baselines, and sometimes in various search scenarios (various training budget). Besides, we also investigate how an initial population gathered on the tabular benchmark can be used for improving search on another dataset, the So2Sat LCZ-42. Our results show similar improvements on the target dataset, despite a limited training budget. Moreover, we analyse the distributions of solutions obtained and find that that the population provided by the data-driven initialization technique enables retrieving local optima (maxima) of high fitness and similar configurations.},

Therefore, we require tools and methods that can help us understand and automatically summarize the vast amount of generated text. There are mainly two types of approaches to perform text summarization: abstractive and extractive. In Abstractive Text Summarization, a concise summary is generated by including the salient features of the input documents and paraphrasing documents using new sentences and phrases. While in Extractive Text Summarization, a summary is produced by selecting and combining the most significant sentences and phrases from the source documents. The researchers have given numerous techniques for both kinds of text summarization. In this work, we classify Extractive Text Summarization approaches and review them based on their characteristics, techniques, and performance. We have discussed the existing Extractive Text Summarization approaches along with their limitations. We also classify and discuss evaluation measures and provide the research challenges faced in Extractive Text Summarization.},

abstract="Let us begin by considering an individual's perception of oneself, the perception of one's own mind and the mind of others, notions related to what is known as solipsism. If solipsism speaks only of the `self' (anthropological perspective), then we could say that emotional intelligence speaks of the `self in relation to others' (sociological perspective). Now, let us turn our attention to the problem at hand, i.e., solipsism and the problem of other minds. Solipsism is sometimes expressed as the view that `I am the only mind which exists,' or `my mental states are the only mental states'. Solipsism is therefore more properly regarded as the doctrine in which `existence' means for me my existence and that of my mental states. Existence is everything that I experience -- physical objects, other people, events and processes, my relation to nature and to another entities. Existence is anything that would commonly be regarded as a constituent of the space and time in which I coexist with others and is necessarily construed by me as part of the content of my consciousness. For the solipsist, it is not merely the case that he believes that his thoughts, experiences, and emotions are, as a matter of contingent fact, the only thoughts, experiences, and emotions. Rather, the solipsist can attach no meaning to the supposition that there could be thoughts, experiences, and emotions other than his own. In short, the true solipsist understands the word `pain', for example, to mean `my pain', the word `nature' to mean `my nature (the natural environment in which I live)', the word `intelligence' to mean `my intelligence'. The solipsist cannot accordingly conceive how this word is to be applied in any sense other than this exclusively egocentric one. The solipsist understands, for example, the destruction of something (a part of the environment) that is `his own', or perhaps at best the destruction of a part of the environment close to him (e.g., a thunderstorm or a flood). However, it is much harder for him to understand -- or he does not, in fact, understand at all -- distant, global problems (e.g., artificial life forms). Let us illustrate solipsism through an example of two stories -- by considering the problem of genesis and existence from two perspectives, the human story, and the Artificial Life Form (ALF) story.",

abstract="This contribution deals with state sovereignty over Internet content regulation at the eve of the 4th industrial revolution. The author argues that the territorial state has taken a central role in regulating Internet content spread on international Internet platforms. The increasing body of state regulation has led to conflicting norms, authorities, and interest. Some state regulation has extraterritorial effects limiting the sovereignty of other states to regulate internet content to their liking. This raises questions about what `sovereignty over the Internet' means. This contribution explores what the role of the state should be in regulating Internet content. Departing from what is often referred to as Westphalian sovereignty, the author argues that this conception of sovereignty offers clarity of what regulation is authoritative. Westphalian sovereignty offers a territorial delineation of rules and authority. Westphalian sovereignty also enables political communities to establish their own rules appropriate to their situation without external interference. Westphalian sovereignty, in other words, offers a pluralistic account of Internet content regulation. On the Internet, a clear delineation in different jurisdictions is, however, not easy to be made. Therefore, the author discusses seven different models of Internet content regulation that take the global nature of the Internet into account. The models discussed vary from no state intervention at all to far-reaching state control over the Internet resulting in fragmentation of the Internet in local networks to ensure the effectivity of state regulation. In discussing these models, the relationship between different states is discussed but also the relationship between state- and private actors require attention. The author reviews propositions to bring Internet content regulation under the control of international organisations such as the United Nations. As this contribution shows, human rights law offer only so-far direction in regulating Internet content. The legal and cultural norms on what is perceived acceptable on the Internet differs between jurisdictions. Fragmentation of the Internet in national networks is the `most Westphalian' solution to conflicts arising between regulation of different states. Requiring Internet platforms to `align' their policies to the jurisdiction where they offer their services to users offers the best trade-off between the unique tenets of Westphalian sovereignty and the specific features of the Internet. There is, however, a downside. Different states may enact different---and even conflicting---norms which may lead to a patchwork of legislation. Because Internet platforms often issue their community guidelines internationally, it is almost impossible for Internet platforms to abide by all national laws. In regulating Internet platforms, the author suggests that cooperation between states---harmonising the law that regulates Internet content---may offer a solution. This contribution also emphasises that state laws should not be enacted lightly and that it must be questioned how state regulation impact the sovereignty of other states.",

Berrigan extends O'Hara's thinking of self-mythologizing in a way that is nuanced by an awareness of the limitations of these linguistic games of identity or ``being the poet.'' In this chapter I read his first volume The Sonnets as tricked myth machines, transforming the traditional form of lyric poetry into a ``revolutionary apparatus,'' while working to produce ``Ted Berrigan'' as a legendary figure of the poet as ``folk-industrial sonneteer'' in contradistinction to the first wave of New York Poets.",

abstract="For those interested in human behavior, developmental science is an essential body of knowledge. The first 3 years of life is a period of rapid change across all domains of development, with the importance of experiences during this initial postnatal window increasingly well documented. The chapter begins by considering theories of development, which address the content of development, and models of development, which address the process of development. The importance of culture as a central context defining the meaning of child and parenting behavior and assigning value to beliefs and practices will be emphasized. The conceptual framework employed describes 3 periods of major qualitative changes in the first 3 years of life. These biobehavioral shifts, occurring roughly at 2--3 months, 7--9 months, and 18--20 months, are periods in which new capacities and behaviors emerge that have not been apparent earlier. The development of the domains of biological-neurological, emotional, social, communicative, and cognitive development are described within each of the 4 periods that these 3 biobehavioral shifts demarcate. The chapter concludes with a discussion of risk and protective factors that influence developmental trajectories of young children. The main, mediating, and moderating effects of risk and protective factors and mechanisms have enormous implications for our understanding of psychopathological processes and their prevention and treatment.",

Now, the advent of depth sensors means that depth maps can easily be captured; this additional spatial information can boost the performance of salient object detection. Although various RGB-D based salient object detection models with promising performance have been proposed over the past several years, an in-depth understanding of these models and the challenges in this field remains lacking. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of RGB-D based salient object detection models from various perspectives, and review related benchmark datasets in detail. Further, as light fields can also provide depth maps, we review salient object detection models and popular benchmark datasets from this domain too. Moreover, to investigate the ability of existing models to detect salient objects, we have carried out a comprehensive attribute-based evaluation of several representative RGB-D based salient object detection models. Finally, we discuss several challenges and open directions of RGB-D based salient object detection for future research.

abstract="This chapter lays out the guiding principles of a methodological experiment and asks the reader to consider the possibility that research topics and representational modalities in contemporary anthropology can be paired accordingly so as to develop a unique narrative format for each individual topic. Focusing on the practice of surrogacy, it puts forth the idea that, during what is commonly referred to as the digital era, the tailor-made character of ethnographic writing acquires new fascinating characteristics and that the juxtaposition between new reproductive technologies and new digital technologies constitutes a vantage point from which we may imagine possible futures of the discipline. The central hypothesis is that fictionalized multimodal stories best illustrate the parallel between assisted reproduction and digitally mediated writing technologies as forms of biosociality and technosociality enabled through recent technological developments. The chapter outlines the theoretical and methodological particularities of ethnography on surrogacy and details the analytic strategies that led to the creation of a digital ethnographic artifact as a representational modality congenial to the subject of research. These particularities include conceptualizations of absence and loss, management of emotional and monetary transactions, perceptions of time and anticipation, the sensitivity of data, and the phenomenology and medicalization of pregnancy and birth.",

Although many privacy-preserving NLP methods have been proposed in recent years, no categories to organize them have been introduced yet, making it hard to follow the progress of the literature. To close this gap, this article systematically reviews over sixty DL methods for privacy-preserving NLP published between 2016 and 2020, covering theoretical foundations, privacy-enhancing technologies, and analysis of their suitability for real-world scenarios. First, we introduce a novel taxonomy for classifying the existing methods into three categories: data safeguarding methods, trusted methods, and verification methods. Second, we present an extensive summary of privacy threats, datasets for applications, and metrics for privacy evaluation. Third, throughout the review, we describe privacy issues in the NLP pipeline in a holistic view. Further, we discuss open challenges in privacy-preserving NLP regarding data traceability, computation overhead, dataset size, the prevalence of human biases in embeddings, and the privacy-utility tradeoff. Finally, this review presents future research directions to guide successive research and development of privacy-preserving NLP models.},

In this way we enter the modern connected worlds, made up of social networks and fuzzy graduations. In this chapter we examine this new family of worlds, and finalize the above communication and graduation tools to the assessment of cognitive algorithms as a counterpart of the inferential tools discussed in the previous chapter. Here the distinction between the conceptual model and the implementing hardware goes to vanish so that we will refer for instance to neural networks or quantum bits which precisely implement a given cognitive algorithm. The common features of these algorithms have to be searched in the triadic architecture Computation-Communication-Memory and in general strategies aimed at optimizing the overall objective of this contrivance, having feedback as a precious communication facility. This chapter offers a reasoned summary of many advances in computer science that have taken place in the last four decades. As such, it's a very streamlined summary, which once again is oriented toward delineating compatible worlds in the province of the golden kit. The reader will probably not find new insights; rather, I hope he will enjoy a systematic view of current cognitive challenges in the field.",

This study discusses the relationship between theory and practice in educational research, and the approaches to achieving their transformation and integration at three levels. First, at the philosophical level, the author clarifies the essence, relationship and development of educational theory and educational practice based on the re-understanding of the representative figures in Western philosophy and their views that have deeply influenced our education academy. Secondly, the author expounds the re-understanding of the specificity of the relationship between theory and practice in educational research, the understanding of the bottom-line question of ``what is education'', the specificity of the complexities of educational research, and the importance of the development of researchers and practitioners in promoting the development of educational theory and educational practice. Finally, taking the ``New Basic Education'' research as an example, which she has been chairing for more than 20 years, the author illustrates how educational theory and educational practice are transformed, integrated and interactively generated in cooperative research, and expounds the ``soul-body integration'' relationship between them.",

abstract="Individual collaborative embedded systems (CESs) in a collaborative system group (CSG) are typically provided by different manufacturers. Variability in such systems is pivotal for deploying a CES in different CSGs and environments. Changing requirements may entail the evolution of a CES. Such changed requirements can be manifold: individual variants of a CES are updated to fix bugs, or the manufacturer changes the entire CES product line to provide new capabilities. Both types of evolution, the variant evolution and the product line evolution, may be performed in parallel. However, neither type of evolution should lead to diverging states of CES variants and the CES product line, otherwise both would be incompatible, it would not be possible to update the CES variants, and it would not be possible to reuse bug fixes of an individual variant for the entire product line. To avoid this divergence, we present an approach for co-evolving variants and product lines, thus ensuring their consistency.",

The prepared evaluation framework includes processes such as (1) collective sensing, (2) problem-solving, (3) decision-making, and (4) collective memory. Separate attention is devoted to the issue of metacognition, understood as the capacity to monitor and regulate our cognitive abilities in the context of public policies. Subsequently, case studies are presented, for which the prepared evaluation framework is applied. The five described cases exemplify successful approaches to utilizing collective intelligence in online policymaking.

The chapter discusses five ethical principles (``ethical imperatives'') and their correlated values that must be respected in the development, deployment and use of AI systems. These ethical principles are: (i) respect for human autonomy; (ii) prevention of harm (non-maleficence); (iii) fairness/justice; (iv) explicability; (v) the principle of beneficence (`do only good'), i.e., the principle of creating AI technology that is beneficial to humanity. It is explained that EU policy-makers have chosen to remain faithful to the EU's cultural preferences and higher standard of protection against the risks posed by AI, building on the existing regulatory framework and ensuring that European values are at the heart of creating the right environment of trust for the successful development and use of AI. The overall aim of the ethics guidelines is---apart from establishing an ethical level playing field across all Member States as well as offering guidance on how to foster and secure the development of ethical AI systems---to bring a European ethical approach to the global stage, i.e. to stimulate discussion of ethical frameworks for AI ``at a global level'' and, therefore, to build an international consensus on AI ethics guidelines.",

  abstract = {In response to rapidly changing market and customer needs, product design and development (PDD) is evolving into a human-centred and data-driven design paradigm. The design environment gets more open often involving crowdsourcing and the design process becomes more complex, considering product family design along product whole lifecycle development, and needing more data support. Therefore, it is critical to effectively capture, share, and manage design-related information in such a complex design environment. From this perspective, it is a prerequisite to have a proper product design lifecycle information model (PDLIM) to guide information gathering, sharing and management. To the best of our knowledge, currently, there lacks such a PDLIM to support effective PDD, though digital twin (DT) technology shows a great potential of supporting product lifecycle information collection and management. In this paper, the overall structure of the proposed PDLIM is firstly developed to frame in all main product lifecycle stages and the corresponding key phases for structurally capturing and storing necessary data along a product lifecycle. Secondly, key design information items against the main product lifecycle stages and their corresponding key phases are explored from literature reviews and case study analyses. Thirdly, the necessity of the identified information items in the PDLIM is qualitatively evaluated by two case studies. Finally, the PDLIM is further evaluated by applying formal object-role modelling (ORM) to demonstrate how design information items are used and interacted in exemplary design interaction scenarios, and to approve that it can be formally described and managed as an information model. The evaluation results show that the PDLIM is feasible to be adapted in a crowdsourcing-combined PDD process for supporting design management, reviewing, quality control, and next round product redesign and improvement.},

abstract="In recent years, there have been unparalleled transformations in computers in terms of their capacity to capture data; to analyse, manipulate, and store them; to disseminate and communicate information; and to apply these capabilities in different areas. This has resulted in an all-pervasive information technology (IT) revolution, viewed by many as the second Industrial Revolution, influencing the very way we live and work in society. Computer-aided design (CAD) is an essential part of this information technology (IT). In this chapter, an overview of integrated CAD and its utility in the AEC sector, urban planning, development, and management is presented. It stresses the need of viewing AEC planning and design as one of the five urban management functions (i.e. planning function) for improving productivity, social equity, and social responsiveness in urban operations. Such an approach is essential for resource-efficient solution of urban development problems, viewing planning and design as a problem-solving process involving search through numerous potential solutions to select a particular solution that meets a specified criterion or goal. This makes computer use and CAD by optimization indispensable in such activities involving civil engineers, architects, and planners (i.e. AEC professionals) who commit huge resources (like money, materials, land) in their planning and design decisions in such operations, enjoining on them an accountability and ethical responsibility to society to ensure efficient use of resources so committed. The book in its various chapters emphasizes the utility of CAD as an integrated optimization tool (for which a number software with source code are provided) and includes a chapter on urban management to enable AEC professionals to comprehend the `big picture' of urban operations to solve problems, resolving conflicting viewpoints in process, enabling adoption of a combined problem-solving approach to derive the above benefits.",

To counterbalance this lack of visual data, each class to recognize is associated with a semantic prototype that reflects the essential features of the object. The general approach is to learn a mapping from visual data to semantic prototypes, then use it at inference to classify visual samples from the class prototypes only. Different settings of this general configuration can be considered depending on the use case of interest, in particular whether one only wants to classify objects that have not been employed to learn the mapping or whether one can use unlabelled visual examples to learn the mapping.

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles require high-level semantic maps, which contain the activities of pedestrians and cars, to ensure safe navigation. High-level semantics can be obtained from mobile probe sensor data. Analyzing pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data is an effective approach to avoid collisions between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Such analyses of pedestrian trajectories can generate new information such as pedestrian behaviors in violation of traffic regulations. However, pedestrian trajectories obtained from mobile probe data significantly sparse and noisy, making it challenging to analyze pedestrian activity. To address this issue, we propose multiple daily data and graph-based approaches to treat sparse and noisy data for estimating the flow of pedestrians based on mobile probe data. To improve the sparseness of the data, multiple daily data are fused. After that, a pedestrian graph is created to enhance the region’s coverage by connecting the sparse data indicating the flow of pedestrians. This proposed approach successfully obtained pedestrian trajectory data from the sparse and noisy data. Moreover, it was possible to identify the potential locations where pedestrians tend to cross the street by analyzing the pedestrian flow. The results indicate that 83% of well-known regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street corresponded with those extracted using the proposed approach. Furthermore, a high-level semantic map of the regions where pedestrians tend to cross the street along a 1-km road is presented. The trajectory information obtained using the proposed approach is expected to be essential for understanding different scenarios of the interactions between individuals and autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract = {Drowsiness is a leading cause of accidents on the road as it negatively affects the driver’s ability to safely operate a vehicle. Neural activity recorded by EEG electrodes is a widely used physiological correlate of driver drowsiness. This paper presents a novel dynamical modeling solution to estimate the instantaneous level of the driver drowsiness using EEG signals, where the PERcentage of eyelid CLOSure (PERCLOS) is employed as the ground truth of driver drowsiness. Applying our proposed modeling framework, we find neural features present in EEG data that encode PERCLOS. In the decoding phase, we use a Bayesian filtering solution to estimate the PERCLOS level over time. A data set that comprises 18 driving tests, conducted by 13 drivers, has been used to investigate the performance of the proposed framework. The modeling performance in estimation of PERCLOS provides robust and repeatable results in tests with manual and automated driving modes by an average RMSE of 0.117 (at a PERCLOS range of 0 to 1) and average High Probability Density percentage of 62.5%. We further hypothesized that there are biomarkers that encode the PERCLOS across different driving tests and participants. Using this solution, we identified possible biomarkers such as Theta and Delta powers. Results show that about 73% and 66% of the Theta and Delta powers which are selected as biomarkers are increasing as PERCLOS grows during the driving test. We argue that the proposed method is a robust and reliable solution to estimate drowsiness in real-time which opens the door in utilizing EEG-based measures in driver drowsiness detection systems.},

In this paper we perform image resizing in feature space using the deep layers of a neural network containing rich important semantic information. We directly adjust the image feature maps, extracted from a pre-trained classification network, and reconstruct the resized image using neural-network based optimization. This novel approach leverages the hierarchical encoding of the network, and in particular, the high-level discriminative power of its deeper layers, that can recognize semantic regions and objects, thereby allowing maintenance of their aspect ratios. Our use of reconstruction from deep features results in less noticeable artifacts than use of imagespace resizing operators. We evaluate our method on benchmarks, compare it to alternative approaches, and demonstrate its strengths on challenging images.},

An integrative multidisciplinary ontological framework is proposed as a basis for synthesizing the workshop participants' emergent understanding of the layers and the key themes. Systems theory is then drawn upon, with the goal of refining and offering a model to both describe and aid the design of DLT systems. Such a scientific model has the power to describe a range of DLT systems, serve as an engineering design model to facilitate assessment of design alternatives, and generate the creation of new (and better) designs. While acknowledging the bounds and limitations of the ``three layer'' model (and of all models), the authors hope it will serve as a starting point for future research to develop a deeper understanding of DLT systems and how they might best be designed.",

Critical indicators reveal that business as usual is going to result in the collapse of key biophysical ocean functions, with major implications for the global economy and societies (IPCC 2019). Science has demonstrated that these close systemic interlinkages in and among ecological, economic and social systems require solutions which are responsive and flexible, robust yet elastic (SDG 2019).",

abstract="In this chapter, we seek to illuminate the dangerous, active, pervasive, and personal nature of settler colonialism within US higher education. We use an electrical current metaphor to conceptualize settler institutions of higher education in relation with settler colonialism and to convey how that relationship needs to be rewired to forge Indigenous centered futures in higher education. To accomplish this, first, we reflect on how our personal experiences with settler colonialism brought us together to write this chapter. We also describe how we approached our writing process collaboratively to support one another and to push against settler colonial writing conventions. Second, we contrast Indigenous and settler colonial ways of knowing and being. Third, we offer an analytical framework, which draws on concepts of power, the social, as well as place and space, for making sense of how we encounter Indigenous and settler colonial ways of knowing and being throughout our interactions in higher education. Fourth, we explore the tensions and possibilities of transforming settler colonial institutions of higher education into Indigenous Centered Institutions. Finally, we offer our conclusions and implications for dreaming vibrant Indigenous futures through solidarities against settler colonialism.",

abstract="In neoliberal societies labour-power pursues the career of the entrepreneurial self which is psychological, rather than professional. Subjects who have interiorised the rule of their own exploitation, i.e. capital, and replaced it with the principle of their own liberation, i.e. labour-power, are the expression of a condition that is divided between the desire to be integrated and subordination to command. In this process a space of becoming emerges. It is historically determined although it cannot yet be determined by the power that precedes and regulates the representation of human capital. The process of liberation, in fact, is never ending.",

abstract="This chapter describes a number of different approaches to improve the performance of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), i.e. variants of BERT, autoregressive language models similar to GPT, and sequence-to-sequence models like Transformers. First we may modify the pre-training tasks to learn as much as possible about the syntax and semantics of language. Then we can extend the length of the input sequence to be able to process longer inputs. Multilingual models are simultaneously trained with text in different languages. Most important is the inclusion of further knowledge into the PLM to produce better predictions. It turns out that by increasing the number of parameters, the size of the training data and the computing effort the performance of the models can always be increased. There are a number of different fine-tuning strategies which allow the model to be adapted to special tasks. In addition, models may be instructed by few-shot prompts to solve specific tasks. This is especially rewarding for larger PLMs, which therefore are called Foundation Models.",

pages="741--772",
abstract="Food security, the tenth element of national security, is not about food alone but also nutrition and hunger removal. The objective of food security is zero hunger, a global term that includes extreme hunger and hidden hunger. Hidden hunger is the demand for nutritional food that improves human physical and mental health. Zero hunger is the second of the 17 goals in the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. Hunger demands food; malnutrition risks health and productivity of people. A large number of people in the world are hungry and malnourished. This adds to the cost of healthcare also. Women and girl children get second priority in food accessibility in many parts of the world. It also shows compromising bias in food security. National governments may understand it when governing to optimise food security. They have to ensure food security beyond minimum subsistence of its people. The Food and Agricultural Organisation believes food insecurity in its global dimensions may persist in some regions. The key areas that need the attention of governments besides agricultural production are governing other food sources such as livestock and fisheries, handling social concerns related to rural economies, population, education, communication and others. For this, food security needs to be governed by aligning other aspects of national security, especially the elements in a global perspective. Food security is defined in different ways. The concluding part of this chapter includes the definition of food security from the perspective of national security governance. Food security was associated with various issues including population in the early days. But population rise need not be a cause for hunger. This study believes there is enough food for all in the world, and food production will increase to meet the requirement unlike the Malthusian predictions. The trends are visible for such appreciation. Therefore, it is the production and distribution processes that are to be streamlined for access to food for the people. It is possible to achieve it. Maximising food security means governing the right of people to food. The challenges to governance will be specific to the respective nations. From monsoon to political unrests, conflicts, riots to militancy can play havoc with food production and distribution. Natural disaster is another challenge. Marginalised and vulnerable people will suffer more under such situations. The fall in arable land and environmental issues can cause depletion of food sources. Ultimately, food security is a question of making healthy and nutritional food available to all people without prejudice for a healthy life. That will make the global human system healthy and productive. It has to be the objective of every national government.",

The parallel use of machine learning, image processing, and fluid control technologies has brought many interesting and novel research perspectives. In this survey, we provide an introduction to theoretical concepts underpinning physics-based fluid simulation and their practical implementation, with the aim for it to serve as a guide for both newcomers and seasoned researchers to explore the field of physics-based fluid simulation, with a focus on developments in the last decade. Driven by the distribution of recent publications in the field, we structure our survey to cover physical background; discretization approaches; computational methods that address scalability; fluid interactions with other materials and interfaces; and methods for expressive aspects of surface detail and control. From a practical perspective, we give an overview of existing implementations available for the above methods.},

  abstract = {Basidiomycota is one of the major phyla in the fungal tree of life. The outline of Basidiomycota provides essential taxonomic information for researchers and workers in mycology. In this study, we present a time-framed phylogenomic tree with 487 species of Basidiomycota from 127 families, 47 orders, 14 classes and four subphyla; we update the outline of Basidiomycota based on the phylogenomic relationships and the taxonomic studies since 2019; and we provide notes for each order and discuss the history, defining characteristics, evolution, justification of orders, problems, significance, and plates. Our phylogenomic analysis suggests that the subphyla diverged in a time range of 443–490 Myr (million years), classes in a time range of 312–412 Myr, and orders in a time range of 102–361 Myr. Families diverged in a time range of 50–289 Myr, 76–224 Myr, and 62–156 Myr in Agaricomycotina, Pucciniomycotina, and Ustilaginomycotina, respectively. Based on the phylogenomic relationships and divergence times, we propose a new suborder Mycenineae in Agaricales to accommodate Mycenaceae. In the current outline of Basidiomycota, there are four subphyla, 20 classes, 77 orders, 297 families, and 2134 genera accepted. When building a robust taxonomy of Basidiomycota in the genomic era, the generation of molecular phylogenetic data has become relatively easier. Finding phenotypical characters, especially those that can be applied for identification and classification, however, has become increasingly challenging.},

  abstract = {Image-Based Simulation (IBSim) is the process by which a digital representation of a real geometry is generated from image data for the purpose of performing a simulation with greater accuracy than with idealised Computer Aided Design (CAD) based simulations. Whilst IBSim originates in the biomedical field, the wider adoption of imaging for non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT/NDE) within the High-Value Manufacturing (HVM) sector has allowed wider use of IBSim in recent years. IBSim is invaluable in scenarios where there exists a non-negligible variation between the ‘as designed’ and ‘as manufactured’ state of parts. It has also been used for characterisation of geometries too complex to accurately draw with CAD. IBSim simulations are unique to the geometry being imaged, therefore it is possible to perform part-specific virtual testing within batches of manufactured parts. This novel review presents the applications of IBSim within HVM, whereby HVM is the value provided by a manufactured part (or conversely the potential cost should the part fail) rather than the actual cost of manufacturing the part itself. Examples include fibre and aggregate composite materials, additive manufacturing, foams, and interface bonding such as welding. This review is divided into the following sections: Material Characterisation; Characterisation of Manufacturing Techniques; Impact of Deviations from Idealised Design Geometry on Product Design and Performance; Customisation and Personalisation of Products; IBSim in Biomimicry. Finally, conclusions are drawn, and observations made on future trends based on the current state of the literature.},

  abstract = {With the advances in scientific foundations and technological implementations, optical metrology has become versatile problem-solving backbones in manufacturing, fundamental research, and engineering applications, such as quality control, nondestructive testing, experimental mechanics, and biomedicine. In recent years, deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, is emerging as a powerful tool to address problems by learning from data, largely driven by the availability of massive datasets, enhanced computational power, fast data storage, and novel training algorithms for the deep neural network. It is currently promoting increased interests and gaining extensive attention for its utilization in the field of optical metrology. Unlike the traditional “physics-based” approach, deep-learning-enabled optical metrology is a kind of “data-driven” approach, which has already provided numerous alternative solutions to many challenging problems in this field with better performances. In this review, we present an overview of the current status and the latest progress of deep-learning technologies in the field of optical metrology. We first briefly introduce both traditional image-processing algorithms in optical metrology and the basic concepts of deep learning, followed by a comprehensive review of its applications in various optical metrology tasks, such as fringe denoising, phase retrieval, phase unwrapping, subset correlation, and error compensation. The open challenges faced by the current deep-learning approach in optical metrology are then discussed. Finally, the directions for future research are outlined.},

abstract="Sometime in the future, in the collective memory of Chinese women, the turn from the nineteenth to the twentieth century, with all its historical and cultural changes, must be a moment of endless fascination: silent women who had cowered in the corners of history, as if buried for more than 2000 years, pushed their way out of the yellow earth, and, for the first time in history, rose to step into Chinese history. Of course, the rock-solid crust of history was not like the graves of ill-starred lovers in beautiful ancient folktales that could magically open, merely because of women's wishes. However, Chinese women's unchronicled, stagnant existence has taken advantage of one of the most critical moments in the history of the nation's existence to step into the temporal flow of history. As the most vocal spokespersons for their gender, modern Chinese women writers, at the advent of a cultural rupture, found their language, gained ground on public podiums, and won their own audience. This is one of the most significant events in Chinese history. It is undeniable that Chinese women's destiny has been inextricably intertwined with the fate of China and Chinese history. Their progression from the back burner to the forefront, whether considered as a historical phenomenon or a gender-based group experience, is thought-provoking and worthy of examination. It calls for not only a diachronic study of their history, but also a synchronic study to tease out how they emerged from the underground to the surface. Women's yesterday, today, and tomorrow do not by any means represent the past, present, and future of the nation, but they can unravel what the latter has so far carefully kept secret.",

  abstract = {Traditional image resizing methods usually work in pixel space and use various saliency measures. The challenge is to adjust the image shape while trying to preserve important content. In this paper we perform image resizing in feature space using the deep layers of a neural network containing rich important semantic information. We directly adjust the image feature maps, extracted from a pre-trained classification network, and reconstruct the resized image using neural-network based optimization. This novel approach leverages the hierarchical encoding of the network, and in particular, the high-level discriminative power of its deeper layers, that can recognize semantic regions and objects, thereby allowing maintenance of their aspect ratios. Our use of reconstruction from deep features results in less noticeable artifacts than use of imagespace resizing operators. We evaluate our method on benchmarks, compare it to alternative approaches, and demonstrate its strengths on challenging images.},

  abstract = {With the advent of Internet, images and videos are the most vulnerable media that can be exploited by criminals to manipulate for hiding the evidence of the crime. This is now easier with the advent of powerful and easily available manipulation tools over the Internet and thus poses a huge threat to the authenticity of images and videos. There is no guarantee that the evidences in the form of images and videos are from an authentic source and also without manipulation and hence cannot be considered as strong evidence in the court of law. Also, it is difficult to detect such forgeries with the conventional forgery detection tools. Although many researchers have proposed advance forensic tools, to detect forgeries done using various manipulation tools, there has always been a race between researchers to develop more efficient forgery detection tools and the forgers to come up with more powerful manipulation techniques. Thus, it is a challenging task for researchers to develop h a generic tool to detect different types of forgeries efficiently. This paper provides the detailed, comprehensive and systematic survey of current trends in the field of image and video forensics, the applications of image/video forensics and the existing datasets. With an in-depth literature review and comparative study, the survey also provides the future directions for researchers, pointing out the challenges in the field of image and video forensics, which are the focus of attention in the future, thus providing ideas for researchers to conduct future research.},

abstract="This chapter provides a thorough and systematic analysis of the Commission's proposed AI Act which set harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI systems in the EU following a proportionate risk-based approach. The proposed AI Act must be reviewed and adopted by the European Parliament and Member States before it comes into effect and, to this end, the Commission's proposed AI Act is being discussed by the co-legislators (the main decision-making bodies of the EU), i.e., the European Parliament (``the Parliament'') and the Council of the European Union (``the Council''). This chapter compares the Commission's proposed AI Act with the Council's numerous ``compromise'' proposals (from November 2021 to December 2022) which attempted to find a common position between Member States. The Council's AI Act final version (general approach) of 11 November 2022 received unanimous approval from the Committee of Permanent Representatives on 18 November 2022, and its formal adoption by EU ministers took place at the Telecom Council meeting on 6 December 2022. This chapter also takes into account the European Parliament's views on all major and controversial issues, revealing the position the European Parliament is likely to adopt in the forthcoming negotiations with the Commission and the Council on the text of the AI Act. It covers the process of preparing the Parliament's compromise proposal, taking account of the comments/amendments which were submitted by political groups represented in the European Parliament and which set the tone for future discussions and political negotiations in order to reach a majority via compromises.",

Robots can utilize diverse communication channels to interact with humans, such as hearing, speech, sight, touch, and learning. Our focus, amidst the various means of interactions between humans and robots, is on three emerging frontiers that significantly impact the future directions of human–robot interaction (HRI): (i) human–robot collaboration inspired by human–human collaboration, (ii) brain-computer interfaces, and (iii) emotional intelligent perception. First, we explore advanced techniques for human–robot collaboration, covering a range of methods from compliance and performance-based approaches to synergistic and learning-based strategies, including learning from demonstration, active learning, and learning from complex tasks. Then, we examine innovative uses of brain-computer interfaces for enhancing HRI, with a focus on applications in rehabilitation, communication, brain state and emotion recognition. Finally, we investigate the emotional intelligence in robotics, focusing on translating human emotions to robots via facial expressions, body gestures, and eye-tracking for fluid, natural interactions. Recent developments in these emerging frontiers and their impact on HRI were detailed and discussed. We highlight contemporary trends and emerging advancements in the field. Ultimately, this paper underscores the necessity of a multimodal approach in developing systems capable of adaptive behavior and effective interaction between humans and robots, thus offering a thorough understanding of the diverse modalities essential for maximizing the potential of HRI.},

Juxtaposing Pound's fascination with the ideogram and idiosyncratic Italian with Pasolini's move into cinema, it reviews their attempts to coin new languages founded on the image which strive to transcend the corruption of the verbal. Close readings of Pasolini's Theorem and the 1967 interview reveal that Pound's presence in his work should be traced in the link between image and text, drawing attention to Poundian elements in his `cinema of poetry'. Situating these poets in relation to twentieth-century avant-garde experiment, the chapter shows how Pasolini's late-1960s verse channels Pound to resist its commodification.",

Variation is a result of the principles repetition, contrast, alteration, with a wide span between permutation of in themselves unchanged components and developing new ones.

abstract="Our lives and values shape our research, so diary reflections and reflections on our memories are important contributions to knowing ourselves a little better and also allowing the readers to have a sense of the researcher's own life. Social anthropologists have made diary keeping not merely an art form, but a way to guide their thinking and to reflect on their own ``taken for granted'' views as a result of their upbringing and culture of origin. In the past diaries were only a means to reflect on the personal, in order to recognise subjectivity, so that it could be bracketed or set aside and not permitted to shape or influence perceptions. Like all reflections, it is based on a bricolage of events and experiences that provide a world view. Nevertheless I do my best to examine my assumptions and values and to reflect on daily events and memories. Daily self-reflection within two communities in Fish Hoek, South Africa and Burnside, South Australia provides a context for observation by a white middle class woman with dual citizenship. The diary notes strive to make sense of personal and political events that play out during 2021--2022 as the pandemic, climate change and war unfolds and then in 2023, post-Covid when extreme amounts of load shedding (power outages) changed the way of life of South Africans.",

abstract="The complexity of today's multi-processor architectures raises the need to increase the level of abstraction of software development paradigms above third-generation programming languages (e.g., C/C++). Code generation from model-based specifications is considered as a promising approach to increase the productivity and quality of software development, with respect to traditional paradigms where code is used as the main artifact to develop software. In this context, powerful and robust tools are needed in order to accomplish the transition from code-based programming to model-based programming. In this paper we propose a novel approach and tools where system-level models are compiled into standard C code while optimizing the system's memory footprint. We show the effectiveness of our approach with the model-based programming of UML/SysML diagrams for a 5G decoder. From the compiled C code, we generate both a software implementation for a Digital Signal Processor platform and a hardware-software implementation for a platform based on hardware Intellectual Property (IP) blocks. Our optimizations achieve a memory footprint reduction of 80.07{\%} and 88.93{\%}, respectively.",

The recoveries work when various different types of anomalies are triggered any number of times at any point in the task, including during already running recoveries. Our recovery critic stands atop of a tightly-integrated, graph-based online motion-generation and introspection system. Policies, skills, and introspection models are learned incrementally and contextually over time. Recoveries are studied via a collaborative kitting task where a wide range of anomalous conditions are experienced in the system. We also contribute an extensive analysis of the performance of the tightly integrated anomaly identification, classification, and recovery system under extreme anomalous conditions. We show how the integration of such a system achieves performances greater than the sum of its parts.},

Second, we contrast Indigenous and settler colonial ways of knowing and being. Third, we offer an analytical framework, which draws on concepts of power, the social, as well as place and space, for making sense of how we encounter Indigenous and settler colonial ways of knowing and being throughout our interactions in higher education. Fourth, we explore the tensions and possibilities of transforming settler colonial institutions of higher education into Indigenous Centered Institutions.

  abstract = {The unprecedented escalation and proliferation of digital multimedia and Internet technology have triggered the enormous copyright infringement issues and tampering of digital content. Detection or localization of copy–paste forgery of digital content and distinguishing between original and manipulated video have become a weighty challenge at the present era of multimedia technology. Several distortions such as rotation, scaling and gamma correction are applied into an original video by an adversary to manipulate the original video for copyright infringement. Due to the emergence of ubiquitous digital videos on the Internet and to surpass the challenges, various copy detection schemes have been introduced by several researchers. Many real-time applications such as detection of duplicate Web videos and monitoring of real-time TV commercial media content over multi-broadcast channels require the robust copy detection approach for high security purpose. The other applications include the rapid advancement of video navigation and editing technology such as finding the opening sequence of a TV show and combining or editing similar versions of the same video for copyright infringement. This paper depicts a comprehensive overview of robust visual hashing to identify similar video contents for digital piracy detection, which overcomes the demerits of conventional cryptographic hash functions and watermarking. The paramount goal of this scheme is to generate the perceptual hash code of fixed size of length from video segments which are robust against distinct distortions or attacks such as scaling, rotation, compression, frame rate change, frame dropping, contrast enhancement, etc., made by an adversary. Besides, in this paper, distinct state-of-the-art schemes used for copy detection have been studied thoroughly and classified based on the methodology they have implemented.},

Therefore, ensuring the correctness of regular expressions is a vital prerequisite for their use in practical applications. The importance and necessity of ensuring correct definitions of regular expressions have attracted extensive attention from researchers and practitioners, especially in recent years. In this study, we provide a review of the recent works for ensuring the correct usage of regular expressions. We classify those works into different categories, including the empirical study, test string generation, automatic synthesis and learning, static checking and verification, visual representation and explanation, and repairing.

abstract="Global risk looms over life as a whole, and thinking about ravaging consequences for human and non-human existence is not extravagant whatsoever. The possibility of an existential catastrophe has boosted rapidly nowadays, so believing that humanity faces no credible threat is not sustainable already in light of evidences. Conjecturing about human future does not seem to be a trivial task, since biotechnological developments encompass a whole constellation of new possible risks never faced before in the history of our species. This scenario demands, today more than ever, positive actions from different regions of human thought. Ultimately, we, the humans, have caused the outbreak of this whole new array of global dangers. For this reason, we are the ones called to rethink our existence. And thinking also means acting. The abeyance of thought and action are not acceptable attitudes at the present time. One of the ways to control the biotechnological hatching is regulating its practices, and in doing this task, biolaw plays a key role, since it has the ability to create binding regulatory frameworks to govern such inventions, but it can also foster the production of public policies to predict and manage potential biotechnological aftermaths.

abstract="Having defined transparency in the previous chapter, the aim of this present chapter is to clarify the most important terms involved in the main argument of the book---ideology, hegemony, neoliberalism, and critique. This is a crucial and necessary step, not simply because these are highly contested terms with a long history and a wide variety of interpretations, but also because they are, as I show, deeply related to transparency. Conquering our desire for authenticity through the ideological performance of neutrality has become one of the most crucial operations of present-day ideology. By appropriating the semantic fields associated with transparency, and modulating the conceptual distance between surplus and lack, a new stage in the evolution of ideology has commenced. What we are witnessing today are the maturing stages of a globally hegemonic neoliberal mindscape, one in which ideology ceases to focus on rational arguments, opinions, and demands, and begins to operate on a metaphorical dimension that both structures and supersedes the level of semantic content. By discussing ideas by Marx, Gramsci, Simmel, and Foucault---among other notable thinkers---I lay out the theoretical bases needed to critique and re-conceptualise ideology from the perspective of transparency. This move gives us a different perspective from where to look at the critique of sociohistorical forms of control, power, and centralisation---instead of truth, the production of belief; along with meaning, sociocultural valence; in the place of rationality, a reconsideration of the role of affect.",

  abstract = {Digitization is developing fast and has become a powerful tool for digital planning, construction and operations, for instance digital twins. Now is the right time for constructive approaches and to apply ethics-by-design in order to develop and implement a safe and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) application. So far, no study has addressed the key research question: Where can corporate digital responsibility (CDR) be allocated, and how shall an adequate ethical framework be designed to support digital innovations in order to make full use of the potentials of digitization and AI? Therefore, the research on how best practices meet their corporate responsibility in the digital transformation process and the requirements of the EU for trustworthy AI and its human-friendly use is essential. Its transformation bears a high potential for companies, is critical for success and thus, requires responsible handling. This study generates data by conducting case studies and interviewing experts as part of the qualitative method to win profound insights into applied practice. It provides an assessment of demands stated in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations (SDGs), White Papers on AI by international institutions, European Commission and German Government requesting the consideration and protection of values and fundamental rights, the careful demarcation between machine (artificial) and human intelligence and the careful use of such technologies. The study discusses digitization and the impacts of AI in construction engineering from an ethical perspective. This research critically evaluates opportunities and risks concerning CDR in construction industry. To the author’s knowledge, no study has set out to investigate how CDR in construction could be conceptualized, especially in relation to digitization and AI, to mitigate digital transformation both in large, medium- and small-sized companies. This study applies a holistic, interdisciplinary, inclusive approach to provide guidelines for orientation and examine benefits as well as risks of AI. Furthermore, the goal is to define ethical principles which are key for success, resource-cost-time efficiency and sustainability using digital technologies and AI in construction engineering to enhance digital transformation. This study concludes that innovative corporate organizations starting new business models are more likely to succeed than those dominated by a more conservative, traditional attitude.},

We propose that machine vision systems are inherently biased not only because they rely on biased datasets but also because their perceptual topology, their specific way of representing the visual world, gives rise to a new class of bias that we call perceptual bias. Concretely, we define perceptual topology as the set of those inductive biases in machine vision systems that determine its capability to represent the visual world. Perceptual bias, then, describes the difference between the assumed “ways of seeing” of a machine vision system, our reasonable expectations regarding its way of representing the visual world, and its actual perceptual topology. We show how perceptual bias affects the interpretability of machine vision systems in particular, by means of a close reading of a visualization technique called “feature visualization”. We conclude that dataset bias and perceptual bias both need to be considered in the critical analysis of machine vision systems and propose to understand critical machine vision as an important transdisciplinary challenge, situated at the interface of computer science and visual studies/Bildwissenschaft.},

  abstract = {Salient object detection (SOD) is a long-standing research topic in computer vision with increasing interest in the past decade. Since light fields record comprehensive information of natural scenes that benefit SOD in a number of ways, using light field inputs to improve saliency detection over conventional RGB inputs is an emerging trend. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and a benchmark for light field SOD, which has long been lacking in the saliency community. Firstly, we introduce light fields, including theory and data forms, and then review existing studies on light field SOD, covering ten traditional models, seven deep learning-based models, a comparative study, and a brief review. Existing datasets for light field SOD are also summarized. Secondly, we benchmark nine representative light field SOD models together with several cutting-edge RGB-D SOD models on four widely used light field datasets, providing insightful discussions and analyses, including a comparison between light field SOD and RGB-D SOD models. Due to the inconsistency of current datasets, we further generate complete data and supplement focal stacks, depth maps, and multi-view images for them, making them consistent and uniform. Our supplemental data make a universal benchmark possible. Lastly, light field SOD is a specialised problem, because of its diverse data representations and high dependency on acquisition hardware, so it differs greatly from other saliency detection tasks. We provide nine observations on challenges and future directions, and outline several open issues. All the materials including models, datasets, benchmarking results, and supplemented light field datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/kerenfu/LFSOD-Survey.},

Blockchain, the technology underpinning the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, has been touted as a possible solution and panacea for the pharmaceutical industry to overcome the aforementioned concerns. Vigilant information systems enable organisations to make quick decisions in real-time in dynamic supply chain environments. Currently, the concept of blockchain vigilant information systems and their impact on supply chain decision making has not been researched in the pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, using an inductive grounded theory approach, we investigate pharmaceutical blockchain use cases and present an emergent multi-layer pharmaceutical blockchain vigilant information system (PBVIS) model. The various capabilities of each layer for pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders are discussed. Research implications and fruitful avenues for future research studies are also presented in this chapter.",

abstract="The discourse on gender and sexuality seems to be a very contemporary debate, but it has always been a topic of philosophy. The difference to current debates lies in the focus: the philosophers of the last 2500 years (they were mainly men) took up the problem within the framework of other fields of discussion, such as ethics, jurisprudence and political science and usually with recourse to nature. In this context, gender corresponded to biological sex, the anatomy of the human being. On this basis, conclusions were drawn about the character of the man and the relationship between the sexes was justified. This is reflected, in particular, in statements about sexuality and the role of reproduction. Since the twentieth century, however, authors have focused on gender and sexuality as independent topics. Thereby a break with the previous theories takes place.",

  abstract = {The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be a transformative experiment for gravitational wave astronomy, and, as such, it will offer unique opportunities to address many key astrophysical questions in a completely novel way. The synergy with ground-based and space-born instruments in the electromagnetic domain, by enabling multi-messenger observations, will add further to the discovery potential of LISA. The next decade is crucial to prepare the astrophysical community for LISA’s first observations. This review outlines the extensive landscape of astrophysical theory, numerical simulations, and astronomical observations that are instrumental for modeling and interpreting the upcoming LISA datastream. To this aim, the current knowledge in three main source classes for LISA is reviewed; ultra-compact stellar-mass binaries, massive black hole binaries, and extreme or interme-diate mass ratio inspirals. The relevant astrophysical processes and the established modeling techniques are summarized. Likewise, open issues and gaps in our understanding of these sources are highlighted, along with an indication of how LISA could help making progress in the different areas. New research avenues that LISA itself, or its joint exploitation with upcoming studies in the electromagnetic domain, will enable, are also illustrated. Improvements in modeling and analysis approaches, such as the combination of numerical simulations and modern data science techniques, are discussed. This review is intended to be a starting point for using LISA as a new discovery tool for understanding our Universe.},

abstract="The objects we choose to throw away, and how we discard those objects, can reveal much about materiality and the material basis of capitalism in the twenty-first century. This chapter explores how analyses of the assemblages and locations of recent illegal dumping events illuminate tensions between structural forces, the ways we relate to our possessions, and the motivations prompting the severance of those relationships. Using data gathered during a faculty-student research project addressing contemporary surface assemblages, we also examine the emotive capacities of illegally discarded belongings. With an analytic emphasis on intact assemblages, we argue that acknowledging the emotional contours of unsanctioned discard not only complements methodologically rigorous, data-driven archaeologies of the contemporary but also provides a forum for grappling with fieldworkers' affective responses to handling culturally familiar objects. Such responses, in turn, can help to cultivate deeper-seated empathy and respect for non-Western connections to objects, space, and place in other archaeological research contexts.",

abstract="Eggs are nature's successful evolutionary design tricks, well designed to deliver multi-task biofunctional strategies for life's challenges. They appear in the vital scenario in the form of original and surprising bio-tech design solutions affected by the genetic and environmental constraints they are called to interact with. For these basic survival needs, the eggs must work very well: capturing the sperm of the male for a correct optimization of the fertilization processes, protection from physical and mechanical trauma, climatic mediation, and fine aeration of the internal larvae. These surprising embryo packagings are a sort of lifeboat laid down and often left alone by females in front of the intricate, complex, and highly wild food interweaving the planet's ecosystems. We found eggs in the reproductive cycles of many living species: fish, cephalopods, birds, and above all, individual insects. Butterfly eggs constitute a class of exciting and still little studied solutions, considered for possible bionic and biomimetic inspirations. Many Lepidoptera eggs generally have an external textured shell, the chorion, made up of waxed surface keratin, which maintains the correct humidity of the egg throughout the growth cycle. Keratin is a fibrous protein rich in sulfur amino acids, cysteine, and self-assemble into fiber bundles. It has the characteristic of a very tenacious mineralized fabric and is remarkably impermeable to water and atmospheric gases. Each egg is glued by the mother's butterfly to the support of branches or leaves of the nourishing plants by a gluey substance of chemical still largely unknown constitution, so adhesive that it is impossible to detach the eggs if not breaking them. In some butterfly species, like the Maniola and Lycaenidae family, the shell's structure has a spatial organization in the form of complex geodesic ribbed micro domes that resemble Buckminster Fuller's geodesic structures. Another exciting aspect of butterfly's eggs design concerns the micropyle and aeropyles layers system, which ensure the proper introduction of the male sperm, air, and oxygen needed to larva's growth. This study, conducted by the BionikonLab{\&}FABNAT14 laboratory of Iglesias-SU Italy, considers the structural, morphological, and geometric aspects of some types of butterfly eggs that await internal ventilation. The purpose is to define a list of essential design problem-solving concepts that apply to creating food packaging, considering the crucial aspects of preserving freshness and commercial and nutritional qualities, reducing food waste, and the additional use of chemicals, antioxidants, and plastics packs.",

  abstract = {Predicting the possible development directions of a product is useful for planning innovative products. Therefore, a systematic approach based on link prediction is proposed in this study to predict possible development directions of a product. In this approach, a target product is represented as a set of cooperative patent classifications (i.e., product CPCs) contained in the patents related to the product, and the new CPCs identified by link prediction are considered possible directions for product development. The approach analyzes co-occurrences of CPCs in the entire the united states patent and trademark office database to construct a universal CPC network, which contains the technological combination records with high potential of success already tried and qualified through patent registration. Next, it constructs a sub-network of the universal network consisting of the product CPCs and their adjacent CPCs (i.e., candidate CPC) and then creates a product-centered network by introducing an artificial product node, which means the target product itself, to the sub-network. Lastly, applying our link prediction approach, this approach calculates the possibility of entering the product CPCs for all candidate CPCs. Consequently, we can discover possible technical elements that can flow into the target product. To show the workings of the approach, this study applies it to a case of smartphones and validates its performance. We expect that this approach can provide hints on a product’s future development directions and assist experts and firms in establishing strategic product planning or identifying the new functional development of products.},

The fastest rising topics are typically called bursts; for example “deep learning”, “internet of things” and “big data”. Being able to automatically detect and track bursty terms in the literature could give insight into how scientific thought evolves over time. In this paper, we take a trend detection algorithm from stock market analysis and apply it to over 30 years of computer science research abstracts, treating the prevalence of each term in the dataset like the price of a stock. Unlike previous work in this domain, we use the free text of abstracts and titles, resulting in a finer-grained analysis. We report a list of bursty terms, and then use historical data to build a classifier to predict whether they will rise or fall in popularity in the future, obtaining accuracy in the region of 80%. The proposed methodology can be applied to any time-ordered collection of text to yield past and present bursty terms and predict their probable fate.},

Combining elements from statistical learning, causal interventionism, and decision theory, we design an idealised explanation game in which players collaborate to find the best explanation(s) for a given algorithmic prediction. Through an iterative procedure of questions and answers, the players establish a three-dimensional Pareto frontier that describes the optimal trade-offs between explanatory accuracy, simplicity, and relevance. Multiple rounds are played at different levels of abstraction, allowing the players to explore overlapping causal patterns of variable granularity and scope. We characterise the conditions under which such a game is almost surely guaranteed to converge on a (conditionally) optimal explanation surface in polynomial time, and highlight obstacles that will tend to prevent the players from advancing beyond certain explanatory thresholds. The game serves a descriptive and a normative function, establishing a conceptual space in which to analyse and compare existing proposals, as well as design new and improved solutions.},

As normal operations, they lead to an explosive growth of online video volume, and inevitably give rise to the massive near-duplicate contents. Near-duplicate video retrieval (NDVR) has always been a hot topic. The primary purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey and an updated review of the advance on large-scale NDVR to supply guidance for researchers. Specifically, we summarize and compare the definitions of near-duplicate videos (NDVs) in the literature, analyze the relationship between NDVR and its related research topics theoretically, describe its generic framework in detail, investigate the existing state-of-the-art NDVR systems. Finally, we present the development trends and research directions of this topic.},

abstract="In Chap. 5 (IT support), a brief overview of the history and the basic hardware components of planning and reporting solutions is given. The software solutions for the planning and reporting tasks are distinguished between special ERP systems, spreadsheet programs, special software programs (based on relational database technology) and data warehouse or business intelligence supported systems. For data warehouse or business intelligence supported systems, the focus of the investigation is on the OLAP data modeling, the OLAP storage concepts, the ETL processes, the different analysis tools, such as cockpit and dashboard solutions and portals. In addition, the latest developments in BI-supported controlling with the support of traditional and exploratory BI are shown, among others, big data technology, data discovery, data visualization, data mining, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, chatbots, RPA, app technology, self service BI and cloud computing. Big data helps, among other things, with the processing speed (in-memory technology) of large heterogeneous data sets. Modern navigation interfaces can be created using the app technology with its tile types. Data discovery or visual discovery tools support big data analytics in terms of their forecasting and analysis capabilities. Especially data mining and predictive analytics receive a further boost for analysis and forecasting tasks, among others, through machine learning, deep learning and neural networks. Chatbots are computer-based dialogue systems that offer new possibilities for faster and more resource-efficient information provision for the users. With robotic process automation (RPA), there is another IT approach that can be used as an intermediate technology in controlling to replace tedious manual IT maintenance by software robots. Cloud computing is an interesting outsourcing option for companies, where IT services and resources can be used via external IT resources. Further innovations concern the topics of data quality and data modeling. The conclusion of this chapter is the topic of ``mobile BI'', which is about the expansion of powerful mobile analysis and planning solutions with the help of tablets, phones and other mobile devices.",

From a set of approx. 7500 documents we looked at word frequencies and topic modelling using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) in order to detect changes and trends. We identified 50 topics using the LDA model. We found that the topics around social aspects, gamification and datafication play an increasing role. We find evidence for this in both LDA and word frequencies. We qualitatively asses the topic models using our own publications and find a high match of detected topics and our ground truth.",

abstract="Chapter 3establishes the discursive frame for a South-South Contemporary Dance. Beginning with a reflection on principles of becoming, that are then linked to meaning-making, signification, and transformation, it suggests that recurrent practices of just world-making, connecting with local ecologies, healing, and spirituality are core to this different choreographic mode. It also reimagines some of the hallmarks of contemporary dance from the perspective of South-South artists, revealing the under-side of the concepts favored by Euro-American constructions. It works through the multi-dimensional work of decolonization that artists must take on as they mark their difference in contemporary dance-making. This chapter argues for the value of aesthetically specific practice, especially in differentiation from the pedestrian vocabulary of postmodern dance. Ultimately, it reflects on the absent communities conjured through such specific practice, and why such invocations are crucial to the justice-based self-definition of contemporary dance and its reconstituted global stage.",

abstract="Hacker artefacts, knowledges, practices and scenes constitute an alternative engineering culture that can be characterised as anti-modern techno-science. Constructed in the wake of the 1960s cultural shock, hackers' attitude to technology is reminiscent of the cybernetic ontology identified by Andrew Pickering and articulated in the sciences by cyberneticians. Figurations of cybernetics abound in the European hacker tradition, signalling the popular reception of cybernetic ideas. Hacker practices privilege practice over representation, performance over cognition, and adaptive encounters with the unknown over the domination of Nature. Hacker ethics revolves around drawing out material resistances in dialogical situations reminiscent of meeting the other in Emmanuel L{\'e}vinas's philosophy. In short, hacking as an alternative engineering culture is informed and forged by an experience in the ontology of becoming. However, while cyberneticians lost their social basis through which they could articulate a non-modern approach to science, hacker scenes continue to maintain clubs and conventions to sustain an anti-modern take on engineering.",

  abstract = {Nineteenth-century psychiatrists ascribed to a model of health that was predicated on the existence of objective and strictly defined laws of nature. The allegedly “natural” rules governing the production of consumption of food, however, were structured by a set of distinctively bourgeois moral values that demonized over-indulgence and intemperance, encouraged self-discipline and productivity, and treated gentility as an index of social worth. Accordingly, the asylum acted not only as a therapeutic instrument but also as a moral machine that was designed to remake lazy, indolent transgressors into useful, “decorous” citizens. Because the theory and mechanics underlying this machine seemed straightforward and self-evident to psychiatrists, they were confounded when the asylum failed to translate its ideals into reality. While psychiatrists tended to blame this failure on the intractable immorality and weakness of individual patients, particularly paupers and immigrants, a review of the various meanings and uses of food in the hospital reveals the fault lines that ran through the asylum’s ideological structure.},

Peirce himself, who was the real founder of a cognitive semiotics, wrote that any reference to a mind in his semiotics was ``a sop to Cerberus'', because he despaired ``of making my own broader conception understood'' (LW: 81). On this topic, the semiotic tradition followed a noble legacy in the history of philosophy, one whose founders are Kant and Husserl. According to this conception, thought is not related to a psychology of the mind, but rather to the logical operations which represent the conditions of possibility of the latter.",

  abstract = {This report presents the conceptual design of a new European research infrastructure EuPRAXIA. The concept has been established over the last four years in a unique collaboration of 41 laboratories within a Horizon 2020 design study funded by the European Union. EuPRAXIA is the first European project that develops a dedicated particle accelerator research infrastructure based on novel plasma acceleration concepts and laser technology. It focuses on the development of electron accelerators and underlying technologies, their user communities, and the exploitation of existing accelerator infrastructures in Europe. EuPRAXIA has involved, amongst others, the international laser community and industry to build links and bridges with accelerator science — through realising synergies, identifying disruptive ideas, innovating, and fostering knowledge exchange. The Eu-PRAXIA project aims at the construction of an innovative electron accelerator using laser- and electron-beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration that offers a significant reduction in size and possible savings in cost over current state-of-the-art radiofrequency-based accelerators. The foreseen electron energy range of one to five gigaelectronvolts (GeV) and its performance goals will enable versatile applications in various domains, e.g. as a compact free-electron laser (FEL), compact sources for medical imaging and positron generation, table-top test beams for particle detectors, as well as deeply penetrating X-ray and gamma-ray sources for material testing. EuPRAXIA is designed to be the required stepping stone to possible future plasma-based facilities, such as linear colliders at the high-energy physics (HEP) energy frontier. Consistent with a high-confidence approach, the project includes measures to retire risk by establishing scaled technology demonstrators. This report includes preliminary models for project implementation, cost and schedule that would allow operation of the full Eu-PRAXIA facility within 8—10 years.},

In the moment the haigui reject their formal training as financial workers, they begin to act like, and metamorphose with, the mass of scattered investors, the sanhu. The intersubjectivity between these actors becomes a mirror that reflects their common subjection to money as the ultimate arbiter---one which supplants state loyalties. In this context and under recurrent financial crises, the state risks losing its grip on the subjectivity of trained and untrained experts, who first become alienated and then potential unruly subjects.",

Higgs boson pairs produced non-resonantly or in the decay of a narrow scalar resonance in the mass range from 251 to 1600 GeV are targeted. Events in which at least one τ-lepton decays hadronically are considered, and multivariate discriminants are used to reject the backgrounds. No significant excess of events above the expected background is observed in the non-resonant search. The largest excess in the resonant search is observed at a resonance mass of 1 TeV, with a local (global) significance of 3.1σ (2.0σ). Observed (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limits are set on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair-production cross-section at 4.7 (3.9) times the Standard Model prediction, assuming Standard Model kinematics, and on the resonant Higgs boson pair-production cross-section at between 21 and 900 fb (12 and 840 fb), depending on the mass of the narrow scalar resonance.},

abstract="Since the expansion of literacy and the popularization of reading, and even more so since the advent of film and subsequently television, attitudes towards the media from the perspective of education, sociology and psychology have been critical, with a gradual shift to rational optimism and even occasional moments of euphoria. Over the course of history---once censorship and strict protection have been overcome---children, young people and adults have been expected or required to have different abilities and skills for dealing with media, depending on the state of development of the media environment. In the English-speaking countries and on an international level, this discourse has mainly been conducted in terms of `literacy' or `media literacy', while in the German-speaking countries in particular, but also in other European regions, the term `competence' or `media competence' can also be found. The concept of media competence is similar to that of media literacy in many respects, and in practice the term is often translated into English as `media literacy'. In actual fact, however, the terms are not synonymous, as their theoretical roots and those of the related concepts differ. The aim of the following section is to take a closer look at the theoretical approaches and concepts behind the terms `media literacy' and `media competence', in order to detect differences, identify common ground and highlight mutually illuminating perspectives.",

  abstract = {Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic model checking (PMC) is a well-established method for the quantitative analysis of state based operational models such as Markov decision processes. Description logics (DLs) provide a well-suited formalism to describe and reason about knowledge and are used as basis for the web ontology language (OWL). We investigate how such knowledge described by DLs can be integrated into the PMC process, introducing ontology-mediated PMC. Specifically, we propose ontologized programs as a formalism that links ontologies to behaviors specified by probabilistic guarded commands, the de-facto standard input formalism for PMC tools such as Prism. Through DL reasoning, inconsistent states in the modeled system can be detected. We present three ways to resolve these inconsistencies, leading to different Markov decision process semantics. We analyze the computational complexity of checking whether an ontologized program is consistent under these semantics. Further, we present and implement a technique for the quantitative analysis of ontologized programs relying on standard DL reasoning and PMC tools. This way, we enable the application of PMC techniques to analyze knowledge-intensive systems.We evaluate our approach and implementation on amulti-server systemcase study,where different DL ontologies are used to provide specifications of different server platforms and situations the system is executed in.},

abstract="Kao argues that development economic theory collapses the difference between a flexible definition of improvement as self-determined change and a prescriptive definition of improvement as an ideology in which all nation-states and individuals must participate in global capitalism in order to achieve ``progress.'' The chapter further argues that this collapse reduces possible understandings of ``development.'' Focusing on differentiating between agential and coerced improvement, Kao traces a chain of ideological resemblances that runs from early agrarian capitalism and Enlightenment notions of teleology to Victorian coercive progress and twenty-first-century neoliberalism. The introduction concludes by situating the distinction made between the two kinds of progress described above within the scholarship of postcolonial cinema, adaptation theory, and heritage film criticism. The theoretical and critical engagement provided suggests that adaptation transforms colonial texts for postcolonial purposes; thus, the nineteenth-century British novel can be used to engage creatively with contemporary global problems.",

This clone-and-own practice loses variability information as no explicit connection between the variants is kept.

  abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks are being deployed worldwide from 2020 and more capabilities are in the process of being standardized, such as mass connectivity, ultra-reliability, and guaranteed low latency. However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.},

Evolving software systems are often a time-consuming and error-prone process. This chapter overviews key concepts and principles in the area of software evolution and presents the fundamentals of state-of-the art methods, tools, and techniques for evolving software. The chapter first classifies the types of software changes into four types: perfective changes to expand the existing requirements of a system, corrective changes for resolving defects, adaptive changes to accommodate any modifications to the environments, and finally preventive changes to improve the maintainability of software. For each type of changes, the chapter overviews software evolution techniques from the perspective of three kinds of activities: (1) applying changes, (2) inspecting changes, and (3) validating changes. The chapter concludes with the discussion of open problems and research challenges for the future.",

As input, the system only needs a user to draw a few strokes on the first frame, roughly delimiting the objects to be removed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first system allowing the semi-automatic removal of objects from videos with complex backgrounds. The key steps of our system are the following: after initialization, segmentation masks are first refined and then automatically propagated through the video. Missing regions are then synthesized using video inpainting techniques. Our system can deal with multiple, possibly crossing objects, with complex motions, and with dynamic textures. This results in a computational tool that can alleviate tedious manual operations for editing high-quality videos.},

abstract="The genome expresses itself into a given phenotype in a complex way. Actually, at the basic level, the genome sequence codes for its own translating machinery. It determines the birth of a cellular machinery responsible, in turn, for gene regulation and expression. A particular gene, for instance, codes for RNA polymerase whose function is to transcribe the genes into messenger RNA. Without RNA polymerase there is no messenger RNA, we are faced with the absence of cellular life. However, RNA polymerase is necessary for its very synthesis because it transcribes its gene. Hence the essential circularity that characterizes living organisms. The cellular machinery ``represents'', step by step, the genome into an organism realizing the final stage of what we call the embodiment process. In this sense, the genome and the cellular machinery really interact by establishing an evolving and coupled network: as we shall see one of the key results of this interaction is represented by the continuous engraving (through selection) at the level of the organisms of specific formats: among them we can distinguish, first of all, the formats relative to the architectures of sensorial perception. In this way the circularity proper to life necessarily unfolds in the conditions of Reflexivity.",

abstract="In the years following the establishment of PEG channels, a new political economic regime gained dominance in the US and the West: neoliberalism. This new regime marked a sea change in the philosophies of government leaders, the judiciary, and policy makers regarding the public obligations of media. The philosophies of the free market, deregulation and privatization, came to predominate, although in many ways neoliberalism, while embracing market fundamentalism, did not endorse the traditional views of earlier capitalism. After a discussion of the history and nature of neoliberalism, which emphasizes the role of government in shaping, if not intervening in, free markets, I detail some of the regulatory and political changes that were undertaken in the neoliberal era, focusing on media issues including the organizations influenced by ALEC, which strove to either eliminate cable franchises or move them to the state level, and the 1996 Communications Act, which relaxed ownership rules. Along with the withering away of the fairness doctrine they increased concentration and led to right-wing radio and television. The net effect of these changes was to limit the effectiveness of the public sphere as a forum for open debate in the media and undermine some of the efforts to revitalize civil society. More than in the post--World War II era, neoliberals sought to depoliticize social life and deeply limit and restrict democratic, even popular democratic, initiatives.",

abstract="This chapter shows multiple definitions of the role of patrons in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century texts. John Dryden's prefaces reveal the relative lack of distinction between the roles of patrons, writers, critics and readers in the aristocratic model of the republic of letters and the successive crystallisation of the positions in the field achieved by the antagonisation of the agents resulting from its professionalisation and commercialisation. The antagonism is particularly palpable in the literary representations of booksellers, who have taken over the role of patrons. Writers conventionally portrayed them as self-serving villains who see literature, both authors and readers, solely as source of gain. Such a definition of their role is countered by booksellers in their autobiographies which try and convince the readers that the position of a bookseller does not need to be inimical to that of the authors and readers.",

pages="73--112",
abstract="A revolutionary desire to overthrow unaccountable power shaped both attitudes to the dead and their literary representation in the 1790s; this chapter argues that a belief in the progressive potential of legislative change would do much the same a generation later, during the reformist decades of the early nineteenth century. Such a shift---moving away from a drive to remove the dead from society altogether, and towards a desire to reform and thereby ameliorate their relationship to the living---reflects the changed cultural and political dynamics in the era of social, sanitary, and political reform that emerged in the early nineteenth century. Many of these reformist measures were linked to the emergence of utilitarianism, and this chapter considers its impact on ways of imagining the dead by considering how two utilitarian thinkers---William Godwin and Jeremy Bentham---sought to apply the doctrines of utility to the disposal of the dead human body, in an attempt to undermine the ethical basis upon which the dead had traditionally been granted cultural authority by the living. Should the dead be buried, dissected, or, like Bentham, stuffed and mounted and made into `auto-icons'? Should their graves be marked with a simple wooden cross, along with the fictional graves of characters from novels, or should their heads be preserved in glass and used to build houses? This chapter examines these attempts to apply a consequentialist ethics to the dead, and argues that the more extreme schemes to reform their imagined presence foundered on the problem of emotion, which proved too difficult for Bentham to quantify in his utilitarian calculations: a problem that is exemplified here by paying careful attention to Bentham's own deathbed scene and his subsequent dissection.",

In addition to high production quality, a quick response could determine the success or failure of many companies and factories. One the most effective concepts for achieving a smart manufacturing industry is the use of computer-aided process planning (CAPP) techniques. Computer-aided process planning refers to key technology that connects the computer-aided design (CAD) and the computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) processes. Researchers have used many approaches as an interface between CAD and CAPP systems. In this field of research, a lot of effort has been spent to take CAPP systems to the next level in the form of automatic computer-aided process planning (ACAPP). This is to provide complete information about the product, in a way that is automated, fast, and accurate. Moreover, automatic feature recognition (AFR) techniques are considered one of the most important tasks to create an ACAPP system. This article presents a comprehensive survey about two main aspects: the degree of automation in each required input and expected output of computer-aided process planning systems as well as the benefits and the limitations of the different automatic feature recognition techniques. The aim is to demonstrate the missing aspects in smart ACAPP generation, the limitations of current systems in recognising new features, and justifying the process of selection.},

abstract="Smart sustainable cities are complex systems par excellence. This is manifested in a variety of ways to think of and define the underlying many subsystems as connected and joined together by a web of relationships that interact to produce collective behavior that cannot easily be explained in terms of interactions between the individual constituent elements. As such, they involve special conundrums, intractable problems, and complex challenges pertaining to sustainability and urbanization. It follows that to deal with such systems requires newfangled ways founded on more innovative solutions and sophisticated methods with respect to how cities can be monitored, understood, managed, planned, and developed. This necessitates leveraging the advance and prevalence of ICT in the transition toward the needed sustainable urban development in an increasingly urbanized and computerized world. Importantly, smart sustainable cities require advanced thinking approaches to be well understood and illuminated so as to enable more effective actions necessary for enhancing their functioning and adaptation in ways that guide their development toward sustainability. The aim of this chapter is twofold. Grounded in systems thinking and complexity science as theoretic approaches, this chapter endeavors to systematically explore the key underlying structures, behavioral patterns, conditions, relationships, and interactions pertaining to smart sustainable cities as complex systems, and to elucidate the related principles in terms of methods, mechanisms, and goals. The intent of offering the knowledge to describe and analyze such systems accordingly is to surface noteworthy relationships as well as their implications for sustainability so as to provoke thought, foster deeper understanding, and create fertile insights, with the primary purpose of making visible possible places for actions that improve the contribution of smart sustainable cities to the goals of sustainable development. This can be accomplished by means of devising powerful urban intelligence functions and robust urban simulation models for strategic decision-making based on big data analytics in conjunction with urban design concepts and planning principles of sustainability. Accordingly, this chapter also discusses the potential of big data analytics and related urban intelligence functions and urban simulation models for, and the role of urban design in, catalyzing and advancing the strategic process of sustainable development by proposing innovative approaches and solutions for monitoring, managing, planning, and designing smart sustainable cities of the future. The main argument is that the systems thinking and complexity science are integral to the understanding of smart sustainable cities, which is a moving target in that they are becoming more complex through the very technologies being used to understand them. Moreover, advanced ICT is founded on the application of complexity theory to urban problems in terms of tracking the changing dynamics, disentangling the intractable problems, and tackling the challenges pertaining to urban systems, which are in and of themselves becoming ever more complex. As high-performance computers have become an indispensable source of information, complex systems cannot be understood and studied without the use of computers and big data analytics.",

abstract="Ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNA-Seq) measures the expression levels of several transcripts simultaneously. The readings can be gene, exon, or other regions of interest. Various computational tools have been developed for studying pathogens or viruses from RNA-Seq data by classifying them according to the attributes in several pre-defined classes. However, computational tools and approaches to analyzing complex datasets are still lacking. The development of classification models is highly recommended for the diagnosis and classification of diseases, disease monitoring at the molecular level and research into potential disease biomarkers. In this chapter, we discuss various machine learning approaches for RNA-Seq data classification and their implementation. These advancements in bioinformatics, along with developments in machine learning-based classification, would provide powerful toolboxes for the classification of transcriptome information available through RNA-Seq data.",

In this article, I present an introduction to topic modeling and give an initial review of the research using topic models. I illustrate their capacity by applying them to 2675 articles published in the Journal of Economic History between 1941 and 2016. By comparing the results to traditional research on the JEH and to recent studies on the cliometric revolution, I aim to demonstrate how topic models can enrich economic historians’ methodological toolboxes.},

  abstract = {Search results are presented for physics beyond the standard model in final states with two opposite-charge, same-flavor leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1 of proton-proton collisions at $$ \sqrt{s}=13 $$TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC in 2016. The analysis uses the invariant mass of the lepton pair, searching for a kinematic edge or a resonant-like excess compatible with the Z boson mass. The search for a kinematic edge targets production of particles sensitive to the strong force, while the resonance search targets both strongly and electroweakly produced new physics. The observed yields are consistent with the expectations from the standard model, and the results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of supersymmetry. In a gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) model of gluino pair production with decay chains including Z bosons, gluino masses up to 1500–1770 GeV are excluded at the 95% confidence level depending on the lightest neutralino mass. In a model of electroweak chargino-neutralino production, chargino masses as high as 610 GeV are excluded when the lightest neutralino is massless. In GMSB models of electroweak neutralino-neutralino production, neutralino masses up to 500-650 GeV are excluded depending on the decay mode assumed. Finally, in a model with bottom squark pair production and decay chains resulting in a kinematic edge in the dilepton invariant mass distribution, bottom squark masses up to 980–1200 GeV are excluded depending on the mass of the next-to-lightest neutralino.},

abstract="Certain aspects of Chinua Achebe's work align with Jacque Derrida's compressed thought in the epigraph above. Achebe's project has been described as affirmative in ways that clearly set it apart from, or put it at variance with, Derrida's deconstruction. However, a glance through the lens of Derrida's singular proposition above may in fact unveil a new dimension of Achebe's work, namely: that the mythical or traditional ethos of Achebe's novels are not incompatible with a material theory of production if only we can uncover their actual points of incarnation in material life. These points of incarnation can be located in the multiple pedagogical functions of the texts, as well as within the simultaneously diffused and underlying ideology that define Achebe's artistic philosophy, functions that are equally incarnated in the institutional instruments of textual production, which sometimes operate through and are piloted by the author function. Pedagogical relations and functions reside in the confluence of ideas, models, structures, and bodies. On the basis of this proposition, the novels as an aesthetic exploration of the career of the book in Africa, as well as the author's publishing relationships, can certainly be brought altogether within the grid of a material theory of literary production, but more importantly, these relationships as properties of texts could be seen as consisting ultimately in literary form as an advance consciousness that prefigures, and to some extent preconfigures, ideologies of production and the relations they engender.",
