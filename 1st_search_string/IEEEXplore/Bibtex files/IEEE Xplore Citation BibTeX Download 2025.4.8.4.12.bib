  abstract={Dance-driven music generation aims to generate musical pieces conditioned on dance videos. Previous works focus on monophonic or raw audio generation, while the multi-instrument scenario is under-explored. The challenges associated with dance-driven multi-instrument music (MIDI) generation are twofold: (i) lack of a publicly available multi-instrument MIDI and video paired dataset and (ii) the weak correlation between music and video. To tackle these challenges, we have built the first multi-instrument MIDI and dance paired dataset (D2MIDI). Based on this dataset, we introduce a multi-instrument MIDI generation framework (Dance2MIDI) conditioned on dance video. Firstly, to capture the relationship between dance and music, we employ a graph convolutional network to encode the dance motion. This allows us to extract features related to dance movement and dance style. Secondly, to generate a harmonious rhythm, we utilize a transformer model to decode the drum track sequence, leveraging a cross-attention mechanism. Thirdly, we model the task of generating the remaining tracks based on the drum track as a sequence understanding and completion task. A BERT-like model is employed to comprehend the context of the entire music piece through self-supervised learning. We evaluate the music generated by our framework trained on the D2MIDI dataset and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract={Over the last decade, the long-running endeavour to automate high-level processes in machine learning (ML) has risen to mainstream prominence. Beyond this, an even loftier goal is the pursuit of autonomy, which describes the capability of the system to independently adjust an ML solution over a lifetime of changing contexts. This monograph provides an expansive perspective on what constitutes an automated/autonomous ML system. In doing so, the authors survey developments in hyperparameter optimisation, multicomponent models, neural architecture search, automated feature engineering, meta-learning, multi-level ensembling, dynamic adaptation, multi-objective evaluation, resource constraints, flexible user involvement, and the principles of generalisation. Furthermore, they develop a conceptual framework throughout to illustrate one possible way of fusing high-level mechanisms into an autonomous ML system. This monograph lays the groundwork for students and researchers to understand the factors limiting architectural integration, without which the field of automated ML risks stifling both its technical advantages and general uptake.},

  title={A Unified Framework for Adversarial Patch Attacks against Visual 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Driving}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={The rapid development of vision-based 3D perceptions, in conjunction with the inherent vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, motivates us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks for the 3D detection models in autonomous driving scenarios. Due to the perspective transformation from 3D space to the image and object occlusion, current 2D image attacks are difficult to generalize to 3D detectors and are limited by physical feasibility. In this work, we propose a unified framework to generate physically printable adversarial patches with different attack goals: 1) instance-level hiding—pasting the learned patches to any target vehicle allows it to evade the detection process; 2) scene-level creating—placing the adversarial patch in the scene induces the detector to perceive plenty of fake objects. Both crafted patches are universal, which can take effect across a wide range of objects and scenes. To achieve above attacks, we first introduce the differentiable image-3D rendering algorithm that makes it possible to learn a patch located in 3D space. Then, two novel designs are devised to promote effective learning of patch content: 1) a Sparse Object Sampling Strategy is proposed to ensure that the rendered patches follow the perspective criterion and avoid being occluded during training, and 2) a Patch-Oriented Adversarial Optimization is used to facilitate the learning process focused on the patch areas. Both digital and physical-world experiments are conducted and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, revealing potential threats when confronted with malicious attacks. We also investigate the defense strategy using adversarial augmentation to further improve the model’s robustness.},

  title={RGB-D salient object detection: A survey}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={7},
  number={1},
  pages={37-69},
  abstract={Salient object detection, which simulates human visual perception in locating the most significant object(s) in a scene, has been widely applied to various computer vision tasks. Now, the advent of depth sensors means that depth maps can easily be captured; this additional spatial information can boost the performance of salient object detection. Although various RGB-D based salient object detection models with promising performance have been proposed over the past several years, an in-depth understanding of these models and the challenges in this field remains lacking. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of RGB- D based salient object detection models from various perspectives, and review related benchmark datasets in detail. Further, as light fields can also provide depth maps, we review salient object detection models and popular benchmark datasets from this domain too. Moreover, to investigate the ability of existing models to detect salient objects, we have carried out a comprehensive attribute-based evaluation of several representative RGB-D based salient object detection models. Finally, we discuss several challenges and open directions of RGB-D based salient object detection for future research. All collected models, benchmark datasets, datasets constructed for attribute-based evaluation, and related code are publicly available at https://github.com/taozh2017/RGBD-SODsurvey.},

  abstract={Visual analytics for machine learning has recently evolved as one of the most exciting areas in the field of visualization. To better identify which research topics are promising and to learn how to apply relevant techniques in visual analytics, we systematically review 259 papers published in the last ten years together with representative works before 2010. We build a taxonomy, which includes three first-level categories: techniques before model building, techniques during modeling building, and techniques after model building. Each category is further characterized by representative analysis tasks, and each task is exemplified by a set of recent influential works. We also discuss and highlight research challenges and promising potential future research opportunities useful for visual analytics researchers.},

  abstract={Image segmentation is one of the most basic tasks in computer vision and remains an initial step of many applications. In this paper, we focus on interactive image segmentation (IIS), often referred to as foreground-background separation or object extraction, guided by user interaction. We provide an overview of the IIS literature by covering more than 150 publications, especially recent works that have not been surveyed before. Moreover, we try to give a comprehensive classification of them according to different viewpoints and present a general and concise comparison of the most recent published works. Furthermore, we survey widely used datasets, evaluation metrics, and available resources in the field of IIS.},
