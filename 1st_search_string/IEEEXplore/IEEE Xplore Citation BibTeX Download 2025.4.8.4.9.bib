  abstract={A major problem in education and visual information design is that, while tools to measure people's reading and writing ability with texts and numbers are ripe, the ability to properly process information from data graphics - an ability that can be called Visual Information Literacy - is still off the radar, and even less interest is apparently devoted to its evaluation. The purpose of this research is that of presenting an exploration of methods and tools towards the measurement of data graphics effectiveness and efficiency, and of proposing a definition of `Visual Information Literacy', together with the design of a model characterizing it as a developmental skills progression that covers the cognitive abilities activated when dealing with data graphics. A final goal of this paper is to report a first round of results assessing the validity of the model designed, by bringing statistical evidence that data graphics comprehension depends on the matching of users' ability and data graphics difficulty. The contribution of this paper is twofold: comparing the current research on Visual Information Literacy and advancing it by designing a model for its characterization to allow the design of a Visual Information Literacy measurement scale standard.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={56296-56315},
  abstract={The goal of the paper is to find means for the unification of human-machine duality in collective behavior of people and machines, by conciliating approaches that proceed in opposite directions. The first approach proceeds top-down from non-formalizable, cognitive, uncaused, and chaotic human consciousness towards purposeful and sustainable human-machine interaction. The second approach proceeds bottom-up from intelligent machines towards high-end computing and is based on formalizable models leveraging multi-agent architectures. The resulting work reviews the extent, the merging points, and the potential of hybrid artificial intelligence frameworks that accept the idea of strong artificial intelligence. These models concern the pairing of connectionist and cognitive architectures, conscious and unconscious actions, symbolic and conceptual realizations, emergent and brain-based computing, and automata and subjects. The special authors’ convergent methodology is considered, which is based on the integration of inverse problem-solving on topological spaces, cognitive modelling, quantum field theory, category theory methods, and holonic approaches. It aims to a more purposeful and sustainable human-machine interaction in form of algorithms or requirements, rules of strategic conversations or network brainstorming, and cognitive semantics. The paper addresses the reduction of the impact of AI development on ethics violation. The findings delivered are used to provide perspectives on the shaping of societal, ethical, and normative aspects in the symbiosis between humans and machines. Implementations in real practice are represented.},

  abstract={With the development of Internet technology, the scale of Internet has increased considerably, which brings with a large number of cyber-attacks. Traditional protection techniques are confronted with complex, advanced and ongoing evolvement adversarial situations, which have to be more adaptive and responsive in order to handle future security and privacy problems. Deep Learning (DL), as one of the most currently remarkable machine learning techniques, has a great potential in cybersecurity. In this paper, author is committed to analyze current cyber-attacks, to review recent state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms and Figure out pros and cons of them, and to discuss the feasibility of deep learning technology applied to cybersecurity to defend malware attacks, DDoS attacks and spoofing attacks. This article also analyzes some vulnerabilities of deep learning algorithms and potential security problems which might come out when DL is applied to cybersecurity. Finally, paper discusses some challenges a DL-based defense mechanism has to overcome, and status and future directions of DL-based defense technology.},

  abstract={Recent developments in cutting-edge robotics constantly face increased cyber threats, not only in terms of quantity and frequency of attacks, but also when it comes to quality and severity of the intrusions. This paper provides a systematic overview and critical assessment of state-of-the-art scientific developments in the security aspects of robotics, autonomous systems, and critical infrastructures. Our review highlights open research questions addressing significant research gaps and/or new conceptual frameworks given recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Thus, the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. We first compare and contrast the benefits of multiple cutting-edge AI-based learning algorithms (e.g., fuzzy logic and neural networks) relative to traditional model-based systems (e.g., distributed control and filtering). Subsequently, we point out some specific benefits of AI algorithms to quickly learn and adapt the dynamics of non-linear systems in the absence of complex mathematical models. We also present some potential future research directions (open challenges) in the field. Lastly, this review also delivers an open message to encourage collaborations among experts from multiple disciplines. The implementation of multiple AI algorithms to tackle current security issues in robotics will transform and create novel hybrid knowledge for intelligent cybersecurity at the application level.},

  pages={511-529},
  abstract={Electromagnetic Side Channel Analysis (EM-SCA) is a major area of interest within the field of cybersecurity. EM-SCA makes use of the electromagnetic radiation that naturally leaks from any device that runs on electricity. Information about the observed device can be gained by gathering and analysing these electromagnetic traces. Numerous studies have demonstrated the applicability of this side channel in various environments for legal and illegal objectives. On the other hand, multi-robot systems, including swarm robotics, have received considerable attention in recent years due to their ability to conduct complex tasks using simple robots cooperating with each other. Although multi-robot and swarm robot systems are likely to be widely used in practical applications in the near future, security concerns in this context have not yet received enough attention. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, EM-SCA threats and benefits have never been thoroughly examined in this context before. In order to spotlight this matter, this work begins with a thorough introduction to EM-SCA and provides a taxonomic structure. Then, guided by this taxonomy, we present a range of EM-SCA scenarios that need to be considered in multi-robot applications.},

  title={Diffense: Defense Against Backdoor Attacks on Deep Neural Networks With Latent Diffusion}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={14},
  number={4},
  pages={729-742},
  abstract={As deep neural network (DNN) models are used in a wide variety of applications, their security has attracted considerable attention. Among the known security vulnerabilities, backdoor attacks have become the most notorious threat to users of pre-trained DNNs and machine learning services. Such attacks manipulate the training data or training process in such a way that the trained model produces a false output to an input that carries a specific trigger, but behaves normally otherwise. In this work, we propose Diffense, a method for detecting such malicious inputs based on the distribution of the latent feature maps to clean input samples of the possibly infected target DNN. By learning the feature map distribution using the diffusion model and sampling from the model under the guidance of the data to be inspected, backdoor attack data can be detected by its distance from the sampled result. Diffense does not require knowledge about the structure, weights, and training data of the target DNN model, nor does it need to be aware of the backdoor attack method. Diffense is non-intrusive. The accuracy of the target model to clean inputs will not be affected by Diffense and the inference service can be run uninterruptedly with Diffense. Extensive experiments were conducted on DNNs trained for MNIST, CIFRA-10, GSTRB, ImageNet-10, LSUN Object and LSUN Scene applications to show that the attack success rates of diverse backdoor attacks, including BadNets, IDBA, WaNet, ISSBA and HTBA, can be significantly suppressed by Diffense. The results generally exceed the performances of existing backdoor mitigation methods, including those that require model modifications or prerequisite knowledge of model weights or attack samples.},

  abstract={Standard-essential patents are crucial tools in international trade competition, and standard-essential patent prediction is becoming competition point among countries. However, existing standard-essential patent prediction methods cannot adequately use various patent features, and cannot provide verifiable predicted results on whether a valid patent can be a standard-essential patent or not. To address these issues, this paper proposes a dynamic standard-essential patent prediction model. In our model, we partition different time slots for each patent to extract the dynamic features in each time slot of the patent, and the static features of the patent are extracted. Then we dynamically predict whether the patent can be a standard-essential patent in the next few years or not. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the baseline models in the values of accuracy, precision, recall and F1.},

The first is a brief note on perennial predicaments in the cyber domain, some "state-of-the-art" views. The second is a look at well-known modes of cyber threat. The third focuses on seventeen cases of cyber conflicts for insights these might yield. We ask: what systematic inferences, if any, can be drawn from a set of cases reported in narrative form? Without foreshadowing the nature of the evidence or the reliability of prevailing assessments, we then turn to the fourth perspective and ask: what is the international community doing, if anything, in response to contentions the cyber domain? Invariably, in each of these lines of inquiry we are constrained by the nature of the evidence, the type of methods used, the diversity of damage—to note only a few of the most salient factors. Our purpose overall is to signal, "reader, beware, uncertainties abound."},

  abstract={Human health is increasingly threatened by exposure to hazardous substances, particularly persistent and toxic chemicals. The link between these substances, often encountered in complex mixtures, and various diseases are demonstrated in scientific studies. However, this information is scattered across several sources and hardly accessible by humans and machines. This paper evaluates current practices for publishing/accessing information on hazardous chemicals and proposes a novel platform designed to facilitate retrieval of critical chemical data in urgent situations. The platform aggregates information from multiple sources and organizes it into a structured knowledge graph. Users can access this information through a visual interface such as Neo4J Bloom and dashboards, or via natural language queries using a Chatbot. Our findings demonstrate a significant reduction in the time and effort required to access vital chemical information when datasets follow FAIR principles. Furthermore, we discuss the lessons learned from the development and implementation of this platform and provide recommendations for data owners and publishers to enhance data reuse and interoperability. This work aims to improve the accessibility and usability of chemical information by healthcare professionals, thereby supporting better health outcomes and informed decision-making in the face of patients exposed to chemical intoxication risks.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Log and event analysis form a crucial pillar of modern security operations center (SOC) functions. By centralized collection and monitoring of log data from endpoints, networks, and applications, SOCs gain visibility into potential security issues across the enterprise infrastructure. Effective log collection, storage, and management are crucial capabilities for SOCs to enable comprehensive visibility, efficient investigations, and compliance. Beyond basic alerting and reporting, leading SOCs extract richer insights from expanding log quantities using advanced analytical techniques. Machine learning and statistical analysis empower the detection of both known and unknown threats from log&#x2010;extracted events. Dimensionality reduction represents data relationships in fewer variables for clustering similar events. Anomaly scores evaluate events for deviation from expected baselines. As critical infrastructure and core evidence, robust controls safeguard log data credibility. A diligent defense&#x2010;in&#x2010;depth methodology addresses persistent availability and integrity risks. Common challenges include data variability, identity context gaps, and restrictive extraction application programming interfaces.</p>},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) is envisioned to be natively integrated into the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks to support a diverse range of intelligent applications. Federated edge learning (FEEL) emerges as a vital enabler of this vision by leveraging the sensing, communication, and computation capabilities of geographically dispersed edge devices to collaboratively train AI models without sharing raw data. This article explores the pivotal role of FEEL in advancing both the “wireless for AI” and “AI for wireless” paradigms, thereby facilitating the realization of scalable, adaptive, and intelligent 6G networks. We begin with a comprehensive overview of learning architectures, models, and algorithms that form the foundations of FEEL. We, then, establish a novel task-oriented communication principle to examine key methodologies for deploying FEEL in dynamic and resource-constrained wireless environments, focusing on device scheduling, model compression, model aggregation, and resource allocation. Furthermore, we investigate the domain-specific optimizations of FEEL to facilitate its promising applications, ranging from wireless air-interface technologies to mobile and the Internet of Things (IoT) services. Finally, we highlight key future research directions for enhancing the design and impact of FEEL in 6G.},

  booktitle={Modes of Uncertainty in HCI},
  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Uncertainty is a prevalent characteristic of contemporary life and a central challenge of HCI. As humans, researchers, and designers we encounter uncertainty in a multitude of forms and a variety of settings. The growing attention to uncertainty in HCI is due to the ever increasing expansion of the field and questions and contexts to which we seek to apply HCI research and practice. It is also due to events in the world that force us to engage more directly with questions related to uncertainty. Consequently, society is turning more than ever to data as a means to enable or mediate our understanding of phenomena such as climate change, political turmoil, increased economic upheaval, and a global pandemic. This monograph examines how HCI conceptualizes, situates, and responds to uncertainty - particularly arguing that our ability to respond to such uncertainties is governed to a great extent by the concepts we use to enframe a single, encompassing, overburdened and slippery idea. The authors propose four distinct "modes of uncertainty" to begin to draw together the varied strands of work in HCI that address uncertainty in its many forms. Rather than focusing on uncertainty as a discrete phenomenon in the world to be studied, they look to how research goals, methods, and theoretical frames used in HCI research influence the various ways in which we encounter it. By switching from uncertainty (a noun) to modes of engaging uncertainty (a verb), they foreground uncertainty as a relational concept and show that it is an active and ongoing condition that designers and researchers make present in different fashions depending upon their priorities and the context in which they are working. The authors show that adding modes of uncertainty to our conceptual toolbox facilitates conversation between domains and lets us draw new connections between disparate areas of research including visualization studies, critical design, feminist epistemologies, and sustainability.},

  abstract={The primary function of a database system is to efficiently compute correct answers to user queries. Therefore, robust query processing (RQP), where strong numerical guarantees are provided on query performance, has been a long-standing core objective in the design of industrial-strength database engines. Unfortunately, however, RQP has proved to be a largely intractable and elusive challenge, despite sustained efforts spanning several decades. In this monograph, a holistic coverage of the RQP innovations is provided, and strengths and limitations are highlighted. Further, open technical problems that remain to be solved to make RQP a contemporary reality are also enumerated. In this monograph, representative techniques along these various dimensions are covered. After the introduction, a background to RQP is given. In the chapters thereafter, the authors cover Robust Operators, Plans, and Execution, and then Structural Bounds, Cost Models and Machine Learning Techniques are surveyed. The monograph concludes with a chapter on Holistic Robustness, and Future Directions. The target audience for this monograph includes researchers, developers and students with an interest in the internals of database engines.},

  abstract={High-quality private machine learning (ML) data stored in local data centers becomes a key competitive factor for AI corporations. In this paper, we present a novel insider attack called Matryoshka to reveal the possibility of breaking the privacy of ML data even with no exposed interface. Our attack employs a scheduled-to-publish DNN model as a carrier model for covert transmission of secret models which memorize the information of private ML data that otherwise has no interface to the outsider. At the core of our attack, we present a novel parameter sharing approach which exploits the learning capacity of the carrier model for information hiding. Our approach simultaneously achieves: (i) High Capacity – With almost no utility loss of the carrier model, Matryoshka can transmit over 10,000 real-world data samples within a carrier model which has $220\times$220× less parameters than the total size of the stolen data, and simultaneously transmit multiple heterogeneous datasets or models within a single carrier model under a trivial distortion rate, neither of which can be done with existing steganography techniques; (ii) Decoding Efficiency – once downloading the published carrier model, an outside colluder can exclusively decode the hidden models from the carrier model with only several integer secrets and the knowledge of the hidden model architecture; (iii) Effectiveness – Moreover, almost all the recovered models either have similar performance as if it is trained independently on the private data, or can be further used to extract memorized raw training data with low error; (iv) Robustness – Information redundancy is naturally implemented to achieve resilience against common post-processing techniques on the carrier before its publishing; (v) Covertness – A model inspector with different levels of prior knowledge could hardly differentiate a carrier model from a normal model.},

  abstract={As one of the most common human helminths, hookworm is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity, which seriously threatens human health. Recently, wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has been applied to automatic hookworm detection. Unfortunately, it remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated impressive performance in various image and video analysis tasks. In this paper, a novel deep hookworm detection framework is proposed for WCE images, which simultaneously models visual appearances and tubular patterns of hookworms. This is the first deep learning framework specifically designed for hookworm detection in WCE images. Two CNN networks, namely edge extraction network and hookworm classification network, are seamlessly integrated in the proposed framework, which avoid the edge feature caching and speed up the classification. Two edge pooling layers are introduced to integrate the tubular regions induced from edge extraction network and the feature maps from hookworm classification network, leading to enhanced feature maps emphasizing the tubular regions. Experiments have been conducted on one of the largest WCE datasets with 440K WCE images, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hookworm detection framework. It significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. The high sensitivity and accuracy of the proposed method in detecting hookworms shows its potential for clinical application.},

  abstract={A comprehensive set of security technology enablers will be critically required for communication systems for the 6G era of the 2030s. Trustworthiness must be assured across IoT, heterogenous cloud and networks, devices, sub-networks, and applications. The 6G threat vector will be defined by 6G architectural disaggregation, open interfaces and an environment with multiple stakeholders. Broadly decomposed into domains of cyber-resilience, privacy and trust and their respective intersection, we explore relevant security technology enablers including automated software creation and automated closed-loop security operation, privacy preserving technologies, hardware and cloud embedded anchors of trust, quantum-safe security, jamming protection and physical layer security as well as distributed ledger technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) as a key technology enabler will be pervasive and of pivotal relevance across the security technology stack and architecture. A novel vision for a trustworthy Secure Telecom Operation Map is developed as part of the automated closed loop operations paradigm.},

  abstract={In recent years, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) have played an increasingly significant role in the military and civil fields. The flight control system, as the “hub” of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), is responsible for the key function of autonomous flight, while a reliable and stable navigation system provides important information such as position status for flight control and represents the “sensory” function of the UAV. A highly autonomous and credible UAV requires a navigation system that meets specific requirements for accuracy, integrity, and continuity, resulting in a multitude of sensors on-board the UAV that are heterogeneous, redundant, and multisource, creating a highly complex navigation system. In this article, we review multisensor fusion (MSF) technology for small UAVs over the last 20 years and provide an overview of three typical multisource fusion architectures based on filtering, factor graph optimization, and data-driven, focusing on inductive identification of key technologies for multisource information fusion state estimation systems, including calibration techniques to improve data quality, observability analysis to provide theoretical support, additional model constraint correction using aircraft, and resilient fusion management techniques across all sources. Finally, we propose future directions for UAS navigation systems to address the limitations of the existing systems.},

  volume={18},

  pages={1963-1977},
  abstract={As an ownership verification technique for deep neural networks, the white-box neural network watermark is being challenged by the functionality equivalence attack. By leveraging the structural symmetry within a deep neural network and manipulating the parameters accordingly, an adversary can invalidate almost all white-box watermarks without affecting the network’s performance. This paper introduces the linear functionality equivalence attack, which can adapt to different network architectures without requiring knowledge of either the watermark or data. We also propose NeuronMap, a framework that can efficiently neutralize linear functionality equivalence attacks and can be easily combined with existing white-box watermarks to enhance their robustness. Experiments conducted on several deep neural networks and state-of-the-art white-box watermarking schemes have demonstrated not only the destructive power of linear functionality equivalence attacks but also the defense capability of NeuronMap. Our result shows that the threat of basic linear functionality equivalence attacks against deep neural network watermarks can be effectively solved using NeuronMap.},

  pages={2327-2340},
  abstract={This article explores the threat posed by Hardware Trojans (HTs), malicious circuits clandestinely embedded in hardware akin to software backdoors. Activation by attackers renders these Trojans capable of inducing malfunctions or leaking confidential information by manipulating the hardware’s normal operation. Despite robust software security, detecting and ensuring normal hardware operation becomes challenging in the presence of malicious circuits. This issue is particularly acute in weapon systems, where HTs can present a significant threat, potentially leading to immediate disablement in adversary countries. Given the severe risks associated with HTs, detection becomes imperative. The study focuses on demonstrating the efficacy of deep learning-based HT detection by comparing and analyzing methods using deep learning with existing approaches. This article proposes utilizing the deep support vector data description (Deep SVDD) model for HT detection. The proposed method outperforms existing methods when detecting untrained HTs. It achieves 92.87% of accuracy on average, which is higher than that of an existing method, 50.00%. This finding contributes valuable insights to the field of hardware security and lays the foundation for practical applications of Deep SVDD in real-world scenarios.},

  abstract={The digital transformation brought on by 5G is redefining current models of end-to-end (E2E) connectivity and service reliability to include security-by-design principles necessary to enable 5G to achieve its promise. 5G trustworthiness highlights the importance of embedding security capabilities from the very beginning while the 5G architecture is being defined and standardized. Security requirements need to overlay and permeate through the different layers of 5G systems (physical, network, and application) as well as different parts of an E2E 5G architecture within a risk-management framework that takes into account the evolving security-threats landscape. 5G presents a typical use-case of wireless communication and computer networking convergence, where 5G fundamental building blocks include components such as Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and the edge cloud. This convergence extends many of the security challenges and opportunities applicable to SDN/NFV and cloud to 5G networks. Thus, 5G security needs to consider additional security requirements (compared to previous generations) such as SDN controller security, hypervisor security, orchestrator security, cloud security, edge security, etc. At the same time, 5G networks offer security improvement opportunities that should be considered. Here, 5G architectural flexibility, programmability and complexity can be harnessed to improve resilience and reliability. The working group scope fundamentally addresses the following: •5G security considerations need to overlay and permeate through the different layers of the 5G systems (physical, network, and application) as well as different parts of an E2E 5G architecture including a risk management framework that takes into account the evolving security threats landscape. •5G exemplifies a use-case of heterogeneous access and computer networking convergence, which extends a unique set of security challenges and opportunities (e.g., related to SDN/NFV and edge cloud, etc.) to 5G networks. Similarly, 5G networks by design offer potential security benefits and opportunities through harnessing the architecture flexibility, programmability and complexity to improve its resilience and reliability. •The IEEE FNI security WG's roadmap framework follows a taxonomic structure, differentiating the 5G functional pillars and corresponding cybersecurity risks. As part of cross collaboration, the security working group will also look into the security issues associated with other roadmap working groups within the IEEE Future Network Initiative.},

We address this lack by proposing an algorithm that is able to create a random structure of P&IDs. Different parameters, such as the number and type of components, inflows, and outflows, can be defined.

  abstract={Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of mobile devices. Mobile devices are permeating every aspect of our daily lives. With the increasing usage of mobile devices and intelligent applications, there is a soaring demand for mobile applications with machine learning services. Inspired by the tremendous success achieved by deep learning in many machine learning tasks, it becomes a natural trend to push deep learning towards mobile applications. However, there exist many challenges to realize deep learning in mobile applications, including the contradiction between the miniature nature of mobile devices and the resource requirement of deep neural networks, the privacy and security concerns about individuals' data, and so on. To resolve these challenges, during the past few years, great leaps have been made in this area. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current challenges and representative achievements about pushing deep learning on mobile devices from three aspects: training with mobile data, efficient inference on mobile devices, and applications of mobile deep learning. The former two aspects cover the primary tasks of deep learning. Then, we go through our two recent applications that apply the data collected by mobile devices to inferring mood disturbance and user identification. Finally, we conclude this paper with the discussion of the future of this area.},

  abstract={Access control to patient information has become increasingly important in healthcare systems. It is vital to enhance the security of healthcare systems to avoid data loss despite the various security policies imposed by healthcare management. The issue needs to be resolved with a comprehensive secure framework, which allows users to access data according to their level of confidentiality. This article presents a solution by imposing multi-level security in e-health systems by integrating the Lattice-Based Access Control (LBAC) model and blockchain-based smart contract mechanisms. These mechanisms provide security levels in compliance with data access restrictions among users and resources while maintaining compliance security levels. By using LBAC, you can provide multilevel protection for access control restrictions, whereas smart contracts are used to ensure the transaction process in a decentralized system via an agreement between the parties. A smart contract validates every user and performs the authentication process in the envisioned model, which uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In the blockchain network, the patient’s e-health details are accessed and stored as immutable blocks. Comparing the proposed scheme with existing benchmarking methods reveals that the proposed scheme preserves privacy, maintains transparency, provides an authentication process, maintains data integrity, and provides multilevel access control security. The proposed model performs better than other existing models. As a result, lattice-based access control enhances the security of e-health records.},

  abstract={The field of deep learning has become more and more pervasive in the last years as we have seen varieties of problems being solved using neural processing techniques. Image analysis and detection, control, speech recognition, translation are only a few prominent examples tackled successfully by neural networks. Thereby, the discipline imposes a completely new problem solving paradigm requiring a rethinking of classical software development methods. The high demand for deep learning technology has led to a large amount of competing frameworks mostly having a Python interface - a quasi standard in the community. Although, existing tools often provide great flexibility and high performance, they still lack to deliver a completely domain oriented problem view. Furthermore, using neural networks as reusable building blocks with clear interfaces in productive systems is still a challenge. In this work we propose a domain specific modeling methodology tackling design, training, and integration of deep neural networks. Thereby, we distinguish between three main modeling concerns: architecture, training, and data. We integrate our methodology in a component-based modeling toolchain allowing one to employ and reuse neural networks in large software architectures.},

  abstract={Cloud computing (CC) technologies (viz artificial intelligence (AI), data science, blockchain, &#x201c;big data&#x201d; (BD), etc.) are progressively widespread and practically applied. Researchers face the biggest challenges regarding efficient data access and acquisition. The CPS's efficiency will help researchers advance in CC, cyber&#x2010;attacks (CAs), &#x201c;cyber threats&#x201d; (CTs), and &#x201c;CT intelligence&#x201d; (CTI). Alongside optimally storing the data, one major caveat is security. The best possible protection can enhance data storage/handling to protect end systems from illegal attacks and thefts. Smart environments (SEs) are collections of sensors, actuators, and numerous computing pieces that ease human life. With the booming SEs, data have notably increased, thus demanding smart, optimal management. Sometimes, data processing is inadequate due to risks and resource costs. Some characteristic security difficulties are &#x201c;advanced persistent threats&#x201d; (APTs), denial&#x2010;of&#x2010;service (DoS), eclipse, double&#x2010;spending attacks, and other malware. Thus, advanced AI&#x2010;reliant anomaly discovery and mitigation tactics can address and disentangle the issues above. Cybersecurity (CS) in SEs, sub&#x2010;CPss, and CPSs relates to working well with AI&#x2010;based anomaly detection techniques. This chapter investigates challenges, trends, and prospective design pathways for securely taming networks and CPSs via AI&#x2010;centered, robust, real&#x2010;time, and CC&#x2010;reliant data storage to inhibit unauthorized access and innumerable CAs (e.g., ransomware, spyware, and phishing. This taxonomy bestows readers with an ample AI potential overview to improve CS in different contexts. The chapter inspects future opportunities in emerging CS applications, advanced AI tactics, data representation, and new infrastructures' development for successfully adopting AI&#x2010;based CS (AICS) in today's digital transformation era and syndemic circumstances.},

  title={Backdoor Attacks and Countermeasures in Natural Language Processing Models: A Comprehensive Security Review}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-21},
  abstract={Language models (LMs) are becoming increasingly popular in real-world applications. Outsourcing model training and data hosting to third-party platforms has become a standard method for reducing costs. In such a situation, the attacker can manipulate the training process or data to inject a backdoor into models. Backdoor attacks are a serious threat where malicious behavior is activated when triggers are present; otherwise, the model operates normally. However, there is still no systematic and comprehensive review of LMs from the attacker’s capabilities and purposes on different backdoor attack surfaces. Moreover, there is a shortage of analysis and comparison of the diverse emerging backdoor countermeasures. Therefore, this work aims to provide the natural language processing (NLP) community with a timely review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures. According to the attackers’ capability and affected stage of the LMs, the attack surfaces are formalized into four categorizations: attacking the pretrained model with fine-tuning (APMF) or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), attacking the final model with training (AFMT), and attacking large language model (ALLM). Thus, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into two general classes: sample inspection and model inspection. Thus, we review countermeasures and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. Also, we summarize the benchmark datasets and provide comparable evaluations for representative attacks and defenses. Drawing the insights from the review, we point out the crucial areas for future research on the backdoor, especially soliciting more efficient and practical countermeasures.},

  abstract={The manufacturing industries’ main purpose is transforming raw materials into finished goods, usually on a large industrial scale. The creation and trading of quality manufacturing items could expose challenges that could put a great deal of strain on companies. Delivering a product that needs to meet global high-quality standards, requires: navigating through often a confusing logistical supply chain; customer driven time-to-market deadlines and maybe, if it is a new product, companies will have to cope effectively in terms of cost, design and time required to fulfil this unfamiliar project. This paper highlights the positive influence AI (Artificial Intelligence) has on the manufacturing processes. Contemporary manufacturing industries are characterized by a comparatively low level of IT spending and tend to be at the forefront in the use of IoT (Internet of Things). Predicting and reducing failures can yield significant cost savings in contemporary generation of goods. This paper presents the research on predictive maintenance in AI with the use of Unsupervised Learning (UL) algorithm, related to manufacturing industries. This is done to show how the implementation of innovative technologies is beneficial in terms of reduction in human error and the need for human availability andassistance. All of which leads to the lowering of costs by automating specific parts of the industrial processes and tasks, in this case, predictive maintenance. Innovative technology is common in the present generation, but what is still lacking is the right use when it comes to businesses and specific needs.},

It presents the desired capabilities of an intelligent communications system in the context of wireless coexistence. The chapter discusses the cognitive cycle at length, but this generally involves the process of observe‐orient‐decide‐act, and focuses on intelligent‐radio rather than cognitive‐radio. The implementation of cognitive capability is very much an active area of research. The cognitive resource manager (CRM) framework is capable of supporting both centralized and decentralized network configurations. The CRM toolbox is a library of algorithms used by the CRM core for data pre‐processing, modeling, learning, and decision‐making. The chapter discusses several learning algorithms and their recent application to intelligent radio. Advances in automation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence should only increase our expectations regarding intelligent radio capabilities.},

  abstract={Search systems are often designed to support simple look-up tasks, such as fact-finding and navigation tasks. However, people increasingly use search engines to complete tasks that require deeper learning. In recent years, the search as learning (SAL) research community has argued that search systems should also be designed to support information seeking tasks that involve complex learning as an important outcome. This monograph provides a comprehensive review of prior research in search as learning and related areas. Searching to learn can be characterized by specific learning objectives, strategies, and context. Therefore, the monograph begins with a review of research in education that has aimed at characterizing learning objectives, strategies, and context. Then, review methods used in prior studies to measure learning during a search session are covered. Two important recommendations for future work are studied: (1) measuring learning retention and (2) measuring a learner’s ability to transfer their new knowledge to a novel scenario. Following this, studies that have focused on understanding factors that influence learning during search and search behaviors that are predictive of earning are discussed. Also, tools that have been developed to support learning during search are surveyed. Searching for the purpose of learning is often a solitary activity. Research in self-regulated learning (SRL) aims to understand how people monitor and control their own learning. Therefore, existing models of SRL are researched, as well as methods to measure engagement with specific SRL processes, and tools to support effective SRL. The monograph concludes with suggesting potential areas for future research.},

  abstract={The emergence of Industry 4.0 entails extensive reliance on industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). ICPS promises to revolutionize industries by fusing physical systems with computational functionality. However, this potential increase in ICPS makes them prone to cyber threats, necessitating effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) systems. Privacy provision, system complexity, and system scalability are major challenges in IDS research. We present FedSecureIDS, a novel lightweight federated deep intrusion detection system that combines CNNs, LSTMs, MLPs, and federated learning (FL) to overcome these challenges. FedSecureIDS solves major security issues, namely eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, by employing a simple protocol for symmetric session key exchange and mutual authentication. Our Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective with an accuracy of 98.68%, precision of 98.78%, recall of 98.64%, and an F1-score of 99.05% with different edge devices. The model is similarly performed in conventional centralized IDS models. We also carry out formal security evaluations to confirm the resistance of the proposed framework to known attacks and provisioning of high data privacy and security.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) empowered by end-edge-cloud computing (EECC), where the heterogeneous capabilities of on-device computing, edge computing, and cloud computing are orchestrated to satisfy the diverse requirements raised by resource-intensive and distributed AI computation. Particularly, we first introduce several mainstream computing paradigms and the benefits of the EECC paradigm in supporting distributed AI, as well as the fundamental technologies for distributed AI. We then derive a holistic taxonomy for the state-of-the-art optimization technologies that are empowered by EECC to boost distributed training and inference, respectively. After that, we point out security and privacy threats in DAI-EECC architecture and review the benefits and shortcomings of each enabling defense technology in accordance with the threats. Finally, we present some promising applications enabled by DAI-EECC and highlight several research challenges and open issues toward immersive performance acquisition.},

  year={2023},
  volume={111},
  number={1},
  pages={42-91},
  abstract={Successful integration of deep neural networks (DNNs) or deep learning (DL) has resulted in breakthroughs in many areas. However, deploying these highly accurate models for data-driven, learned, automatic, and practical machine learning (ML) solutions to end-user applications remains challenging. DL algorithms are often computationally expensive, power-hungry, and require large memory to process complex and iterative operations of millions of parameters. Hence, training and inference of DL models are typically performed on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters in the cloud. Data transmission to the cloud results in high latency, round-trip delay, security and privacy concerns, and the inability of real-time decisions. Thus, processing on edge devices can significantly reduce cloud transmission cost. Edge devices are end devices closest to the user, such as mobile phones, cyber–physical systems (CPSs), wearables, the Internet of Things (IoT), embedded and autonomous systems, and intelligent sensors. These devices have limited memory, computing resources, and power-handling capability. Therefore, optimization techniques at both the hardware and software levels have been developed to handle the DL deployment efficiently on the edge. Understanding the existing research, challenges, and opportunities is fundamental to leveraging the next generation of edge devices with artificial intelligence (AI) capability. Mainly, four research directions have been pursued for efficient DL inference on edge devices: 1) novel DL architecture and algorithm design; 2) optimization of existing DL methods; 3) development of algorithm–hardware codesign; and 4) efficient accelerator design for DL deployment. This article focuses on surveying each of the four research directions, providing a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art tools and techniques for efficient edge inference.},

  volume={8},

  pages={66749-66776},
  abstract={Voice disability is a barrier to effective communication. Around 1.2% of the World's population is facing some form of voice disability. Surgical procedures namely laryngoscopy, laryngeal electromyography, and stroboscopy are used for voice disability diagnosis. Researchers and practitioners have been working to find alternatives to these surgical procedures. Voice sample based diagnosis is one of them. The major steps followed by these works are (a) to extract voice features from voice samples and (b) to discriminate pathological voices from normal voices by using a classifier algorithm. However, there is no consensus about the voice feature and the classifier algorithm that can provide the best accuracy in screening voice disability. Moreover, some of the works use multiple voice features and multiple classifiers to ensure high reliability. In this paper, we address these issues. The motivation of the work is to address the need for non-invasive signal processing techniques to detect voice disability in the general population. This paper conducts a survey related to voice disability detection methods. The paper contains two main parts. In the first part, we present background information including causes of voice disability, current procedures and practices, voice features, and classifiers. In the second part, we present a comprehensive survey work on voice disability detection algorithms. The issues and challenges related to the selection of voice feature and classifier algorithms have been addressed at the end of this paper.},

However, the day-to-day challenges and complexities of such natural science that face the stack holders still need more reliable and intelligent solutions. The solution can depend on a partial or integrated system of modern technologies. In this article, we extensively survey the corelated modern technologies aiming to gather the major efforts exerted in this regard. It also outlines the desirability of seismology to modern technologies. Then, we present a detailed analysis of remote sensing and data communication networks (DCNs), which are considered the backend of seismic networks. Furthermore, for seismology, we depict both classical and nonclassical approaches based on DCN principles, such as optical fiber-based acoustic sensors, social media, and the Internet of things (IoT). Following that, a comprehensive description of the various optimization techniques utilized for seismic wave analysis and for prolonging network lifetime is offered. A description of the important functions that artificial intelligence (AI) can play in different fields of seismology is also included. Finally, we present some recommendations for stack holders to prevent natural calamities and preserve human lives.},

As an interdisciplinary field, the field of artificial intelligence has rich knowledge and strategic management significance. This article conducts an in-depth study on the knowledge structure and evolution trends in the field of AI, and the main work is as follows. First, a new potential feature topic model New-LDA is proposed for the study of topic recognition, which enhances the feature learning ability of the traditional LDA model, and makes up for the deficiency of the traditional LDA model in the ability of recognizing topics in complex environments. Second, the knowledge structure in the field of AI is analyzed from two aspects: topic recognition and coword analysis. The time series model is introduced to establish the topic evolution network, and the high-frequency words in three periods are compared and analyzed to find the evolution regular of knowledge structure in the AI domain. Finally, taking the cross-discipline of AI as an example, the thematic evolution of the field and its cross-discipline is analyzed to determine the future development direction and evolutionary trend of the field of AI.},

  abstract={Location-based social networks (LBSNs) have been studied extensively in recent years. However, utilizing real-world LBSN data sets yields several weaknesses: sparse and small data sets, privacy concerns, and a lack of authoritative ground-truth. To overcome these weaknesses, we leverage a large-scale LBSN simulation to create a framework to simulate human behavior and to create synthetic but realistic LBSN data based on human patterns of life. Such data not only captures the location of users over time but also their interactions via social networks. Patterns of life are simulated by giving agents (i.e., people) an array of “needs” that they aim to satisfy, e.g., agents go home when they are tired, to restaurants when they are hungry, to work to cover their financial needs, and to recreational sites to meet friends and satisfy their social needs. While existing real-world LBSN data sets are trivially small, the proposed framework provides a source for massive LBSN benchmark data that closely mimics the real-world. As such, it allows us to capture 100% of the (simulated) population without any data uncertainty, privacy-related concerns, or incompleteness. It allows researchers to see the (simulated) world through the lens of an omniscient entity having perfect data. Our framework is made available to the community. In addition, we provide a series of simulated benchmark LBSN data sets using different synthetic towns and real-world urban environments obtained from OpenStreetMap. The simulation software and data sets, which comprise gigabytes of spatio-temporal and temporal social network data, are made available to the research community.},

  abstract={Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning (ML) that focuses on the development of artificial intelligence. It is also often referred to by its acronym, DL (AI). This technique lays an emphasis on the use of big capacity, scalable models that are able to construct distributed representations depending on the input data set. This proposed illustrates the generalizability of these methods and the usage of them in a broad range of cyber security investigations that are peculiar to their environment. The neural network models have been continuously refined and extended during the whole of this research in order to achieve greater adaptability. The following is a list of the important contributions that this proposed makes, in order from most significant to least significant: Work is currently being done to create a comprehensive database for the identification of domain names that have been generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), as well as a one-of-a-kind architecture that will increase the overall effectiveness of DGA domain name detection. Both of these will help increase overall efficiency. The creation of a hybrid intrusion detection warning system that is founded on a deep neural network (DNN) and that has the capability to monitor network and host-level activities inside an Ethernet local area network (LAN) (LAN). The examination of information gathered from social media platforms, electronic mail (email), and uniform resource locators in order to design a unified, DL-based framework for the detection of spam and phishing (URL). The creation of a technique based on DL for the study of secure shell (SSH) traffic, the categorization of application network traffic, the classification of malicious traffic, and the detection of harmful traffic is being worked on. The name of the new framework that has been suggested, which is called ScaleMalNet, reflects how hybrid and scalable it is. In the first stage, the executables file is classified as malware or genuine by using static and dynamic analysis. In the second stage, the malicious executables _le are grouped into corresponding malware families. This is a two-step process. For the aim of conducting investigations into Android ransomware and malware, an analogous hybrid DL framework is now in the process of being developed. This framework is better in its capacity to detect dangerous software and ransomware on Android when compared to the typical ML-based techniques that are presently in use. These approaches are already in widespread usage. The development of a framework for DNS-based botnet detection and DL-based network intrusion detection is now being worked on in the context of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart cities},

  year={2023},
  volume={20},
  number={6},
  pages={4690-4701},
  abstract={In this work, we present OPUPO to protect machine learning classifiers against black-box membership inference attacks by alleviating the prediction difference between training and non-training samples. Specifically, we apply order-preserving and utility-preserving obfuscation to prediction vectors. The order-preserving constraint strictly maintains the order of confidence scores in the prediction vectors, guaranteeing that the model's classification accuracy is not affected. The utility-preserving constraint, on the other hand, enables adaptive distortions to the prediction vectors in order to protect their utility. Moreover, OPUPO is proved to be adversary resistant that even well-informed defense-aware adversaries cannot restore the original prediction vectors to bypass the defense. We evaluate OPUPO on machine learning and deep learning classifiers trained with four popular datasets. Experiments verify that OPUPO can effectively defend against state-of-the-art attack techniques with negligible computation overhead. In specific, the inference accuracy could be reduced from as high as 87.66% to around 50%, i.e., random guess, and the prediction time will increase by only 0.44% on average. The experiments also show that OPUPO could achieve better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) is shifting from the cloud to the edge. Edge computing reduces the surface exposing private data and enables reliable throughput guarantees in real-time applications. Of the panoply of devices deployed at the edge, resource-constrained microcontrollers (MCUs), e.g., Arm Cortex-M, are more prevalent, orders of magnitude cheaper, and less power-hungry than application processors (APUs) or graphical processing units (GPUs). Thus, enabling intelligence at the so-called deep/extreme edge is the zeitgeist, with researchers focusing on unveiling novel approaches to deploy artificial neural networks (ANN) on these constrained devices. Quantization is a well-established technique that has proved effective, i.e., negligible impact on accuracy, in enabling the deployment of neural networks on MCUs; however, it is still an open question to understand the robustness of quantized neural networks (QNNs) in the face of well-known adversarial examples. To fill this gap, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of attacks and defenses from (full-precision) ANNs on (constrained) QNNs. Our evaluation suite includes three QNNs targeting TinyML applications, ten attacks, and six defenses. With this study, we draw a set of interesting findings. First, quantization increases the point distance to the decision boundary and leads the gradient estimated by some attacks to explode or vanish. Second, quantization can act as a noise attenuator or amplifier, depending on the noise magnitude, and causes gradient misalignment. Regarding adversarial defenses, we conclude that input pre-processing defenses show impressive results on small perturbations; however, they fall short as the perturbation increases. At the same time, train-based defenses increase adversarial robustness by increasing the average point distance to the decision boundary, which holds even after quantization. However, we argue that train-based defenses still need to smooth the quantization-shift and gradient misalignment phenomenons to counteract adversarial example transferability to QNNs. All artifacts are open-sourced to enable independent validation of results and encourage further exploration of the robustness of QNNs.},

  abstract={Online scams pose a growing threat to the cyberspace, with cybercriminals frequently using fake evidence, such as identification and financial documents, to illicitly elevate their credibility in online activities. This deceptive trend is fueled by an emerging set of fake evidence generators (FEGens). These FeGensreplicate the output of authoritative sources, such as official bank applications, to automatically generate large quantities of authentic-looking fake evidence. To the best of our knowledge, FeGens,as effective tools for cybercriminals, have not been systematically analyzed in terms of their supply chain, including development, promotion, and delivery, as well as the risks and impacts they pose to end users. In this paper, we present the first systematic empirical analysis of FegEnsand related fake evidence. Our findings shed light on the FegEn ecosystem, particularly the tactics employed by FegEndevelopers and retailers to mimic authoritative sources and promote the use of FeGens. We also evaluate the effectiveness of FeGensand associated risks in cybercrime.},

  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={184861-184882},
  abstract={Downtime caused by failing equipment can be extremely costly for organizations. Predictive Maintenance (PdM), which uses data to predict when maintenance should be conducted, is an essential tool for increasing safety, maximizing uptime and minimizing costs. Contempoary PdM systems primarily have sensors collect information about the equipment under observation. This information is afterwards transmitted off the device for processing at a high-performance computer system. While this can allow high-quality predictions, it also imposes barriers that keep some organisations from adopting PdM. For example, some applications prevent data transmission off sensor devices due to regulatory or infrastructure limitations. Being able to process the collected information right at the sensor device is, therefore, desirable in many sectors - something that recent progress in the field of TinyML promises to deliver. This paper investigates the intersection between PdM and TinyML and explores how TinyML can enable many new PdM applications. We consider a holistic view of TinyML-based PdM, focusing on the full stack of Machine Learning (ML) models, hardware, toolchains, data and PdM applications. Our main findings are that each part of the TinyML stack has received varying degrees of attention. In particular, ML models and their optimisations have seen a lot of attention, while data optimisations and TinyML datasets lack contributions. Furthermore, most TinyML research focuses on image and audio classification, with little attention paid to other application areas such as PdM. Based on our observations, we suggest promising avenues of future research to scale and improve the application of TinyML to PdM.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={The Technological Emergence of AutoML presents a comprehensive snapshot of how AutoML has permeated into mainstream use within the early 2020s. This work surveys both their implementation and application in the context of industry. It also defines what a ‘performant’ AutoML system is – HCI support is valued highly here – and assesses how the current crop of available packages and services lives up to expectations. To do so in a systematic manner, this survey is structured as follows. Section 2 begins by elaborating on the notion of an ML workflow, conceptually framing AutoML in terms of the high-level operations required to develop, deploy and maintain an ML model. Section 3 uses this workflow to support the introduction of industry-related stakeholders and their interests/obligations. These requirements are unified into a comprehensive set of criteria, supported by methods of assessment, that determine whether an AutoML system can be considered performant. Section 4 launches the survey in earnest, assessing the nature and capabilities of existing AutoML technology beginning with an examination of open-source AutoML packages. The section additionally investigates AutoML systems that are designed for specific domains, as well as commercial products. Subsequently, Section 5 assesses where AutoML technology has been used and how it has fared. Academic work focusing on real-world applications is surveyed, as are vendor-based case studies. All key findings and assessments are then synthesized in Section 6, with commentary around how mature AutoML technology is, as well as whether there are obstacles and opportunities for future uptake. Finally, Section 7 provides a concluding overview on the technological emergence of AutoML.},

  abstract={With the proliferation of 4G and 5G mobile networks in smart cities, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has surged, emphasizing the critical need for robust security measures. Existing firmware attestation techniques often require high computational budget or access to the device’s authentic firmware, posing challenges due to resource and proprietary constraints. To counter these two fundamental challenges, this article introduces a novel software-based attestation framework utilizing RAM traces from IoT devices for remote verification. In the proposed framework, the need for an authentic firmware copy is eliminated, and the most computationally intensive task is assigned to the gateway node of the IoT ecosystem. This approach yields a robust and highly accurate device attestation strategy, while imposing minimal computational demands on the verification device itself. Employing deep learning models trained in a representation learning paradigm, our framework enables the remote verifier to authenticate the internal state of IoT devices. Leveraging data collected from real-world prototype devices, under eight different applications, our approach achieves a remarkable 100% accuracy in detecting critical attacks on IoT devices with a false positive rate of  $10^{-3}$ . Notably, our framework preserves device availability and maintains low authentication latency, underscoring its efficacy and practicality for securing IoT ecosystems.},

  abstract={Recent advances in natural language generation have introduced powerful language models with high-quality output text. However, this raises concerns about the potential misuse of such models for malicious purposes. In this paper, we study natural language watermarking as a defense to help better mark and trace the provenance of text. We introduce the Adversarial Watermarking Transformer (AWT) with a jointly trained encoder-decoder and adversarial training that, given an input text and a binary message, generates an output text that is unobtrusively encoded with the given message. We further study different training and inference strategies to achieve minimal changes to the semantics and correctness of the input text.AWT is the first end-to-end model to hide data in text by automatically learning -without ground truth- word substitutions along with their locations in order to encode the message. We empirically show that our model is effective in largely preserving text utility and decoding the watermark while hiding its presence against adversaries. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method is robust against a range of attacks.},

  abstract={Most of the existing mobile application (app) vetting mechanisms only estimate risks at a coarse-grained level by analyzing app syntax but not semantics. We propose a semantics-aware privacy risk assessment framework (SPRisk), which considers the sensitivity discrepancy of privacy-related factors at semantic level. Our framework can provide qualitative (i.e., risk level) and quantitative (i.e., risk score) assessment results, both of which help users make decisions to install an app or not. Furthermore, to find the reasonable weight distribution of each factor automatically, we exploit a self-learning weight assignment method, which is based on fuzzy clustering and knowledge dependency theory. We implement a prototype system and evaluate the effectiveness of SPRisk with 192,445 normal apps and 7,111 malicious apps. A measurement study further reveals some interesting findings, such as the privacy risk distribution of Google Play Store, the diversity of official and unofficial marketplaces, which provide insights into understanding the seriousness of privacy threat in the Android ecosystem.},

  abstract={Video games are one of the richest and most popular forms of human-computer interaction and, hence, their role is critical for our understanding of human behaviour and affect at a large scale. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools are gradually adopted by the game industry a series of ethical concerns arise. Such concerns, however, have so far not been extensively discussed in a video game context. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive review on the ethics of AI as applied to games, we survey the current state of the art in this area and discuss ethical considerations of these systems from the holistic perspective of the affective loop. Through the components of this loop, we study the ethical challenges that AI faces in video game development. Elicitation highlights the ethical boundaries of artificially induced emotions; sensing showcases the trade-off between privacy and safe gaming spaces; and detection, as utilised during in-game adaptation, poses challenges to transparency and ownership. This paper calls for an open dialogue and action for the games of today and the virtual spaces of the future. By setting an appropriate framework we aim to protect users and to guide developers towards safer and better experiences for their customers.},

  volume={20},
  number={1},
  pages={476-488},
  abstract={Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by poor social communication abilities and repetitive behaviors or restrictive interests, which has brought a heavy burden to families and society. In many attempts to understand ASD neurobiology, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has been an effective tool. However, current ASD diagnosis methods based on rs-fMRI have two major defects. First, the instability of rs-fMRI leads to functional connectivity (FC) uncertainty, affecting the performance of ASD diagnosis. Second, many FCs are involved in brain activity, making it difficult to determine effective features in ASD classification. In this study, we propose an interpretable ASD classifier DeepTSK, which combines a multi-output Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (MO-TSK) fuzzy inference system (FIS) for composite feature learning and a deep belief network (DBN) for ASD classification in a unified network. To avoid the suboptimal solution of DeepTSK, a joint optimization procedure is employed to simultaneously learn the parameters of MO-TSK and DBN. The proposed DeepTSK was evaluated on datasets collected from three sites of the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the discriminant FCs are presented by analyzing the consequent parameters of Deep MO-TSK.},

  pages={3434-3448},
  abstract={Trigger set-based watermarking schemes have gained emerging attention as they provide a means to prove ownership for deep neural network model owners. In this paper, we argue that state-of-the-art trigger set-based watermarking algorithms do not achieve their designed goal of proving ownership. We posit that this impaired capability stems from two common experimental flaws that the existing research practice has committed when evaluating the robustness of watermarking algorithms: (1) incomplete adversarial evaluation and (2) overlooked adaptive attacks. We conduct a comprehensive adversarial evaluation of 11 representative watermarking schemes against six of the existing attacks and demonstrate that each of these watermarking schemes lacks robustness against at least two non-adaptive attacks. We also propose novel adaptive attacks that harness the adversary's knowledge of the underlying watermarking algorithm of a target model. We demonstrate that the proposed attacks effectively break all of the 11 watermarking schemes, consequently allowing adversaries to obscure the ownership of any watermarked model. We encourage follow-up studies to consider our guidelines when evaluating the robustness of their watermarking schemes via conducting comprehensive adversarial evaluation that includes our adaptive attacks to demonstrate a meaningful upper bound of watermark robustness.},

  abstract={Mobile commerce security needs quality services where mobile devices respond in real-time and traditional cloud computing approach uses a centralized architecture does not support these systems with such time dependency well. Thus, this study proposes a cross-age face-recognition model with MobileNets to determine the identity of a user in the situation of aging appearance change on a fog computing architecture. Especially, this study uses a face-recognition technique based on a distributed concept. In this concept, MobileNet-based face recognition system effectively performs cross-age face recognition for identity authentication with the enhanced facial features of the users locally.

  year={2023},
  volume={70},
  number={12},
  pages={5011-5024},
  abstract={Deep neural networks (DNNs) have permeated into many diverse application domains, making them attractive targets of malicious attacks. DNNs are particularly susceptible to data poisoning attacks. Such attacks can be made more venomous and harder to detect by poisoning the training samples without changing their ground-truth labels. Despite its pragmatism, the clean-label requirement imposes a stiff restriction and strong conflict in simultaneous optimization of attack stealth, success rate, and utility of the poisoned model. Attempts to circumvent the pitfalls often lead to a high injection rate, ineffective embedded backdoors, unnatural triggers, low transferability, and/or poor robustness. In this paper, we overcome these constraints by amalgamating different data augmentation techniques for the backdoor trigger. The spatial intensities of the augmentation methods are iteratively adjusted by interpolating the clean sample and its augmented version according to their tolerance to perceptual loss and augmented feature saliency to target class activation. Our proposed attack is comprehensively evaluated on different network models and datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art clean-label backdoor attacks, it has lower injection rate, stealthier poisoned samples, higher attack success rate, and greater backdoor mitigation resistance while preserving high benign accuracy. Similar attack success rates are also demonstrated on the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 edge AI device implementation of the poisoned model after weight-pruning and quantization.},

  pages={30-37},
  abstract={For social robots like Astro which interact with and adapt to the daily movements of users within the home, realistic simulation of human activity is needed for feature development and testing. This paper presents a framework for simulating daily human activity patterns in home environments at scale, supporting manual configurability of different personas or activity patterns, variation of activity timings, and testing on multiple home layouts. We introduce a method for specifying day-to-day variation in schedules and present a bidirectional constraint propagation algorithm for generating schedules from templates. We validate the expressive power of our framework through a use case scenario analysis and demonstrate that our method can be used to generate data closely resembling human behavior from three public datasets and a self-collected dataset. Our contribution supports systematic testing of social robot behaviors at scale, enables procedural generation of synthetic datasets of human movement in different households, and can help minimize bias in training data, leading to more robust and effective robots for home environments.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={6},
  pages={9432-9443},
  abstract={This article presents a neural network model based on edge intelligence for seismic event detection. We implemented the model in hardware using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to achieve in-situ detection of seismic events at acquisition nodes or edge nodes. We designed and implemented the model, focusing on its suitability for hardware implementation on FPGA, employing an encoder—decoder structure. The encoder incorporates reparameterization and depthwise separable convolutions. During training, a multibranch structure was employed, which was then converted to an equivalent single-branch structure during inference to reduce model complexity and parameters. The features extracted by the encoder were further learned by the bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network and then fed into the decoder for classification. We evaluated the model using the stanford earthquake data set (STEAD) and observed a 70% reduction in parameters while achieving comparable detection performance to EQTransformer. Furthermore, the model structure is well-suited for hardware implementation on FPGA. Applying this model to edge devices for seismic event detection can effectively minimize redundant data transmission and enable in-situ quality control.},

  pages={67-105},
  abstract={Hyperspectral anomaly and target detection are two key solutions for detecting objects of interest in hyperspectral imagery with abundant spectral information, according to whether or not a priori knowledge of the object is provided, respectively. The detection has important applications in rare mineral exploration, military target reconnaissance, unknown detection in deep space or deep sea, and so on. The importance of real&#x2010;time detection has recently been realized and recognized in many fields, especially for military. Because moving targets such as tanks, missiles, and unmanned aerial vehicles pose a real threat to ground troops. In this chapter, we retrospect some traditional methods and designed novel detections for real&#x2010;time processing, such as deep pipelined background statistics (DPBS)&#x2010;constrained energy minimization (CEM), deep brief network (DBN)&#x2010;Reed&#x2010;Xiaoli anomaly detector (RXD), Fast&#x2010;automatic target&#x2010;generation process (ATGP), and Fast&#x2010;morphological reconstruction and the simplified guided filtering detector (MGD). In experiments, our proposed methods are conducted on six data sets including TE1, HyMap, ABU, Cuprite, San Diego, and HYDICE. And these detection algorithms are deployed on the FPGA, and more importantly, model&#x2010;based design is considered for hardware implementation. With the validation by the different metrics (AUC scores, LUTs, FFs, time, and so on), our proposed methods accomplish a trade&#x2010;off between detection accuracy and inference speed.},

  pages={2146-2175},
  abstract={Deep learning shows immense potential for strengthening the cyber-resilience of renewable energy supply chains. However, research gaps in comprehensive benchmarks, real-world model evaluations, and data generation tailored to the renewable domain persist. This study explores applying state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to secure renewable supply chains, drawing insights from over 300 publications. We aim to provide an updated, rigorous analysis of deep learning applications in this field to guide future research. We systematically review literature spanning 2020–2023, retrieving relevant articles from major databases. We examine deep learning’s role in intrusion/anomaly detection, supply chain cyberattack detection frameworks, security standards, historical attack analysis, data management strategies, model architectures, and supply chain cyber datasets. Our analysis demonstrates deep learning enables renewable supply chain anomaly detection by processing massively distributed data. We highlight crucial model design factors, including accuracy, adaptation capability, communication security, and resilience to adversarial threats. Comparing 18 major historical attacks informs risk analysis. We also showcase potential deep learning architectures, evaluating their relative strengths and limitations in security applications. Moreover, our review emphasizes best practices for renewable data curation, considering quality, labeling, access efficiency, and governance. Effective deep learning integration necessitates tailored benchmarks, model tuning guidance, and renewable energy data generation. Our multi-dimensional analysis motivates focused efforts on enhancing detection explanations, securing communications, continually retraining models, and establishing standardized assessment protocols. Overall, we provide a comprehensive roadmap to progress renewable supply chain cyber-resilience leveraging deep learning’s immense potential.},

  abstract={Neuromorphic computing represents hardware and software paradigms that emulate neural brain functionalities. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising brain-inspired computing approach to achieve power efficiency through event-driven processing using discrete asynchronous spikes, making them particularly effective for spatiotemporal data processing. The complex computational nature of SNNs requires intensive calculations and specialized algorithms to ensure accurate performance across different tasks. Hardware accelerators for neuromorphic computing, particularly for SNN implementations, have emerged primarily through field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). FPGAs are especially attractive for neuromorphic computing due to their flexibility, stability, programmability, reconfigurability, and rapid time to market. This research explores top-tier and well-known journal articles from the IEEE Xplore digital library and the Google Scholar databases including IEEE, ACM, Frontiers, Elsevier, Springer, MDPI, Wiley, arXiv, and Nature publishers. In this survey, various energy-efficient and high-performance FPGA implementations of spiking neurons and SNNs are reviewed. The accuracy rates of the implemented SNNs on different applications are investigated. Also, digital hardware optimization techniques for reconfigurable implementations are discussed. The synthesis results from the presented implementations are reported and compared in terms of cost (referring to utilized resources such as Registers/FFs, LUTs, Multipliers, DSP blocks, and Block RAMs), speed, and power/energy consumption. The survey concludes with recommendations for future research directions in FPGA-based neuromorphic computing.},

Healthcare systems around the world are now making use of AI to help provide humane solutions using algorithms and Machine Learning (ML). Fallacies or inaccuracies in the arena of healthcare can have horrendous outcomes for the patient on whom the procedure is being carried out. Sometimes, certain ethics could be traded off by the system, such as confidentiality, autonomy, justice, and biased decisions leading to false results and victim blaming, which directs the masses into not trusting AI-related healthcare solutions.

  abstract={We introduce Natural Language Processing for Requirement Forecasting (NLP4ReF), a model-based machine learning and natural language processing solution for enhancing the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. RE continues to face significant challenges and demands innovative approaches for process efficiency. Traditional RE methods relying on natural language struggle with incomplete, hidden, forgotten, and evolving requirements during and after the critical design review, risking project failures and setbacks. NLP4ReF tackles several key challenges: a) distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements, b) classification of requirements by their respective system classes, and c) generation of unanticipated requirements to enhance project success. NLP4ReF employs a common natural language toolkit (NLTK) package and the recently-trending Chat-GPT. We tested NLP4ReF on PROMISE_exp, a pre-existing dataset with 1000 software requirements, and PROMISE_IoT, an enhanced dataset with 2000 software and IoT requirements. We validated NLP4ReF on a genuine IoT project. NLP4ReF swiftly generated dozens of new requirements, verified by a team of systems engineers, of which over 70% were crucial for project success. We found that GPT is superior in authentic requirement generation, while NLTK excels at requirement classification. NLP4ReF offers significant time saving, effort reduction, and improved future-proofing. Our model-based design approach provides a foundation for enhanced RE practices and future research in this domain.},

Exploration of different training strategies for optimizing the watermarking and of the challenges and implications of applying this approach in real-world scenarios clarified the tradeoff between watermark robustness and text quality. Watermark selection substantially affects the generated output for high entropy sentences. This proactive watermarking approach has potential application in future model development.},

  abstract={With the broader and highly successful usage of machine learning (ML) in industry and the sciences, there has been a growing demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Interpretability and explanation methods for gaining a better understanding of the problem-solving abilities and strategies of nonlinear ML, in particular, deep neural networks, are, therefore, receiving increased attention. In this work, we aim to: 1) provide a timely overview of this active emerging field, with a focus on “post hoc” explanations, and explain its theoretical foundations; 2) put interpretability algorithms to a test both from a theory and comparative evaluation perspective using extensive simulations; 3) outline best practice aspects, i.e., how to best include interpretation methods into the standard usage of ML; and 4) demonstrate successful usage of XAI in a representative selection of application scenarios. Finally, we discuss challenges and possible future directions of this exciting foundational field of ML.},

  abstract={Transfer learning (TL) has been successfully applied to many real-world problems that traditional machine learning (ML) cannot handle, such as image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP). Commonly, TL tends to address three main problems of traditional machine learning: (1) insufficient labeled data, (2) incompatible computation power, and (3) distribution mismatch. In general, TL can be organized into four categories: transductive learning, inductive learning, unsupervised learning, and negative learning. Furthermore, each category can be organized into four learning types: learning on instances, learning on features, learning on parameters, and learning on relations. This article presents a comprehensive survey on TL. In addition, this article presents the state of the art, current trends, applications, and open challenges.},

  abstract={In recent years visual place recognition (VPR), i.e., the problem of recognizing the location of images, has received considerable attention from multiple research communities, spanning from computer vision to robotics and even machine learning. This interest is fueled on one hand by the relevance that visual place recognition holds for many applications and on the other hand by the unsolved challenge of making these methods perform reliably in different conditions and environments. This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art of research on visual place recognition, focusing on how it has been shaped by the recent advances in deep learning. We start discussing the image representations used in this task and how they have evolved from using hand-crafted to deep-learned features. We further review how metric learning techniques are used to get more discriminative representations, as well as techniques for dealing with occlusions, distractors, and shifts in the visual domain of the images. The survey also provides an overview of the specific solutions that have been proposed for applications in robotics and with aerial imagery. Finally the survey provides a summary of datasets that are used in visual place recognition, highlighting their different characteristics.},

  abstract={Geometric registration is often an accuracy assurance for most remote sensing image processing and analysis, such as image mosaicking, image fusion, and time-series analysis. In recent decades, geometric registration has attracted considerable attention in the remote sensing community, leading to a large amount of research on the subject. However, few studies have systematically reviewed its current status and deeply investigated its development trends. Moreover, new approaches are constantly emerging, and some issues still need to be solved. Thus, this article presents a survey of state-of-the-art approaches for remote sensing image registration in terms of intensity-based, feature-based, and combination techniques. Optical flow estimation and deep learning-based methods are summarized, and software-operated registration and registration evaluation are introduced. Building on recent advances, promising opportunities are explored.},

  title={Backdoor Attacks Against Transfer Learning With Pre-Trained Deep Learning Models}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={15},
  number={3},
  pages={1526-1539},
  abstract={Transfer learning provides an effective solution for feasibly and fast customize accurate Student models, by transferring the learned knowledge of pre-trained Teacher models over large datasets via fine-tuning. Many pre-trained Teacher models used in transfer learning are publicly available and maintained by public platforms, increasing their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. In this article, we demonstrate a backdoor threat to transfer learning tasks on both image and time-series data leveraging the knowledge of publicly accessible Teacher models, aimed at defeating three commonly adopted defenses: pruning-based, retraining-based and input pre-processing-based defenses. Specifically, ($\mathcal {A}$A) ranking-based selection mechanism to speed up the backdoor trigger generation and perturbation process while defeating pruning-based and/or retraining-based defenses. ($\mathcal {B}$B) autoencoder-powered trigger generation is proposed to produce a robust trigger that can defeat the input pre-processing-based defense, while guaranteeing that selected neuron(s) can be significantly activated. ($\mathcal {C}$C) defense-aware retraining to generate the manipulated model using reverse-engineered model inputs. We launch effective misclassification attacks on Student models over real-world images, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data and Electrocardiography (ECG) learning systems. The experiments reveal that our enhanced attack can maintain the 98.4 and 97.2 percent classification accuracy as the genuine model on clean image and time series inputs while improving $27.9\%-100\%$27.9%-100% and $27.1\%-56.1\%$27.1%-56.1% attack success rate on trojaned image and time series inputs respectively in the presence of pruning-based and/or retraining-based defenses.},

  abstract={Graph networks can model data observed across different levels of biological systems that span from population graphs (with patients as network nodes) to molecular graphs that involve omics data. Graph-based approaches have shed light on decoding biological processes modulated by complex interactions. This paper systematically reviews graph-based analysis methods of Graph Signal Processing (GSP), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph topology inference, and their applications to biological data. This work focuses on the algorithms of graph-based approaches and the constructions of graph-based frameworks that are adapted to a broad range of biological data. We cover the Graph Fourier Transform and the graph filter developed in GSP, which provides tools to investigate biological signals in the graph domain that can potentially benefit from the underlying graph structures. We also review the node, graph, and interaction oriented applications of GNNs with inductive and transductive learning manners for various biological targets. As a key component of graph analysis, we provide a review of graph topology inference methods that incorporate assumptions for specific biological objectives. Finally, we discuss the biological application of graph analysis methods within this exhaustive literature collection, potentially providing insights for future research in biological sciences.},

  pages={20118-20134},
  abstract={Significant advancements and progress made in recent computer vision research enable more effective processing of various objects in high-resolution overhead imagery obtained by various sources from drones, airplanes, and satellites. In particular, overhead images combined with computer vision allow many real-world uses for economic, commercial, and humanitarian purposes, including assessing economic impact from access crop yields, financial supply chain prediction for company’s revenue management, and rapid disaster surveillance system (wildfire alarms, rising sea levels, weather forecast). Likewise, object detection in overhead images provides insight for use in many real-world applications yet is still challenging because of substantial image volumes, inconsistent image resolution, small-sized objects, highly complex backgrounds, and nonuniform object classes. Although extensive studies in deep learning-based object detection have achieved remarkable performance and success, they are still ineffective yielding a low detection performance, due to the underlying difficulties in overhead images. Thus, high-performing object detection in overhead images is an active research field to overcome such difficulties. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview and comparative reviews on the most up-to-date deep learning-based object detection in overhead images. Especially, our work can shed light on capturing the most recent advancements of object detection methods in overhead images and the introduction of overhead datasets that have not been comprehensively surveyed before.},

  abstract={This article examined student experiences before and after an essay writing assignment that required the use of ChatGPT within an undergraduate engineering course. Utilizing a pre–post study design, we gathered data from 24 participants to evaluate ChatGPT's support for both completing and grading an essay assignment, exploring its educational value and impact on the learning process. Our quantitative and thematic analyses uncovered that ChatGPT did not simplify the writing process. Instead, the tool transformed the student learning experience yielding mixed responses. Participants reported finding ChatGPT valuable for learning, and their comfort with its ethical and benevolent aspects increased postuse. Concerns with ChatGPT included poor accuracy and limited feedback on the confidence of its output. Students preferred instructors to use ChatGPT to help grade their assignments, with appropriate oversight. They did not trust ChatGPT to grade by itself. Student views of ChatGPT evolved from a perceived “cheating tool” to a collaborative resource that requires human oversight and calibrated trust. Implications for writing, education, and trust in artificial intelligence are discussed.},

  year={2019},
  volume={27},
  number={2},
  pages={355-366},
  abstract={With the advances of machine learning technologies, data-driven feature extraction and sequence modeling approaches are being widely explored for automatic chord recognition tasks. Currently, there is a bottleneck in the amount of enough annotated data for training robust acoustic models, as hand-annotating time-synchronized chord labels requires professional musical skills and considerable labor. To cope with this limitation, in this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep feature extractor, which is trained on a large set of time, synchronized musical instrument digital interface audio data pairs and can robustly estimate pitch class activations of real-world music audio recordings. The CNN feature extractor plus a bidirectional long short-term memory conditional random field decoding model forms the proposed hybrid system for automatic chord recognition. Experiments show that the proposed model is compatible for both regular major/minor triad chord classification and larger vocabulary chord recognition, and outperforms other state-of-the-art chord recognition systems.},

This paper reviews three intrusion detection techniques: blockchain technologies, machine learning, and deep learning. This survey overviews various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, summarizes blockchain technology, and discusses different blockchain methods used for intrusion detection and cybersecurity.

  abstract={Recent advances in zero-shot image recognition suggest that vision-language models learn generic visual representations with a high degree of semantic information that may be arbitrarily probed with natural language phrases. Understanding an image, however, is not just about understanding what content resides within an image, but importantly, where that content resides. In this work we examine how well vision-language models are able to understand where objects reside within an image and group together visually related parts of the imagery. We demonstrate how contemporary vision and language representation learning models based on contrastive losses and large web-based data capture limited object localization information. We propose a minimal set of modifications that results in models that uniquely learn both semantic and spatial information. We measure this performance in terms of zero-shot image recognition, unsupervised bottom-up and top-down semantic segmentations, as well as robustness analyses. We find that the resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of unsupervised segmentation, and demonstrate that the learned representations are uniquely robust to spurious correlations in datasets designed to probe the causal behavior of vision models.},

  abstract={Aesthetic image captioning (AIC) refers to the multi-modal task of generating critical textual feedbacks for photographs. While in natural image captioning (NIC), deep models are trained in an end-to-end manner using large curated datasets such as MS-COCO, no such large-scale, clean dataset exists for AIC. Towards this goal, we propose an automatic cleaning strategy to create a benchmarking AIC dataset, by exploiting the images and noisy comments easily available from photography websites. We propose a probabilistic caption-filtering method for cleaning the noisy web-data, and compile a large-scale, clean dataset 'AVA-Captions', (~ 230, 000 images with ~ 5 captions per image). Additionally, by exploiting the latent associations between aesthetic attributes, we propose a strategy for training the convolutional neural network (CNN) based visual feature extractor, the first component of the AIC framework. The strategy is weakly supervised and can be effectively used to learn rich aesthetic representations, without requiring expensive ground-truth annotations. We finally show-case a thorough analysis of the proposed contributions using automatic metrics and subjective evaluations.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},

  pages={6851-6860},
  abstract={Many images shared over the web include overlaid objects, or visual motifs, such as text, symbols or drawings, which add a description or decoration to the image. For example, decorative text that specifies where the image was taken, repeatedly appears across a variety of different images. Often, the reoccurring visual motif, is semantically similar, yet, differs in location, style and content (e.g. text placement, font and letters). This work proposes a deep learning based technique for blind removal of such objects. In the blind setting, the location and exact geometry of the motif are unknown. Our approach simultaneously estimates which pixels contain the visual motif, and synthesizes the underlying latent image. It is applied to a single input image, without any user assistance in specifying the location of the motif, achieving state-of-the-art results for blind removal of both opaque and semi-transparent visual motifs.},
