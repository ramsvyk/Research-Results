  abstract={Given the continually rising frequency of cyberattacks, the adoption of artificial intelligence methods, particularly Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL), has become essential in the realm of cybersecurity. These techniques have proven to be effective in detecting and mitigating cyberattacks, which can cause significant harm to individuals, organizations, and even countries. Machine learning algorithms use statistical methods to identify patterns and anomalies in large datasets, enabling security analysts to detect previously unknown threats. Deep learning, a subfield of ML, has shown great potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of cybersecurity systems, particularly in image and speech recognition. On the other hand, RL is again a subfield of machine learning that trains algorithms to learn through trial and error, making it particularly effective in dynamic environments. We also evaluated the usage of ChatGPT-like AI tools in cyber-related problem domains on both sides, positive and negative. This article provides an overview of how ML, DL, and RL are applied in cybersecurity, including their usage in malware detection, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and other areas. The paper also specifies several research questions to provide a more comprehensive framework to investigate the efficiency of AI and ML models in the cybersecurity domain. The state-of-the-art studies using ML, DL, and RL models are evaluated in each Section based on the main idea, techniques, and important findings. It also discusses these techniques’ challenges and limitations, including data quality, interpretability, and adversarial attacks. Overall, the use of ML, DL, and RL in cybersecurity holds great promise for improving the effectiveness of security systems and enhancing our ability to protect against cyberattacks. Therefore, it is essential to continue developing and refining these techniques to address the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats. Besides, some promising solutions that rely on machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are susceptible to adversarial attacks, underscoring the importance of factoring in this vulnerability when devising countermeasures against sophisticated cyber threats. We also concluded that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for cybersecurity, but it should be noted that ChatGPT-like tools can also be manipulated to threaten the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data.},

  abstract={Data-driven science and technology offer transformative tools and methods to science. This review article highlights the latest development and progress in the interdisciplinary field of data-driven plasma science (DDPS), i.e., plasma science whose progress is driven strongly by data and data analyses. Plasma is considered to be the most ubiquitous form of observable matter in the universe. Data associated with plasmas can, therefore, cover extremely large spatial and temporal scales, and often provide essential information for other scientific disciplines. Thanks to the latest technological developments, plasma experiments, observations, and computation now produce a large amount of data that can no longer be analyzed or interpreted manually. This trend now necessitates a highly sophisticated use of high-performance computers for data analyses, making artificial intelligence and machine learning vital components of DDPS. This article contains seven primary sections, in addition to the introduction and summary. Following an overview of fundamental data-driven science, five other sections cover widely studied topics of plasma science and technologies, i.e., basic plasma physics and laboratory experiments, magnetic confinement fusion, inertial confinement fusion and high-energy-density physics, space and astronomical plasmas, and plasma technologies for industrial and other applications. The final Section before the summary discusses plasma-related databases that could significantly contribute to DDPS. Each primary Section starts with a brief introduction to the topic, discusses the state-of-the-art developments in the use of data and/or data-scientific approaches, and presents the summary and outlook. Despite the recent impressive signs of progress, the DDPS is still in its infancy. This article attempts to offer a broad perspective on the development of this field and identify where further innovations are required.},

  abstract={Recently, large language models have gained considerable interest due to their impressive performance on different tasks. OpenAl's ChatGPT is a revolutionary language model that has quickly become popular among early adopters. Many users have gone so far as to call it a disruptive technology in many different domains. Its large, pre-trained model provides powerful capabilities already being applied to various use cases. Gaining an understanding of the thoughts and feelings of those who are quick to embrace new technologies is essential, as it can offer valuable insights into the technology's potential successes, failures, and other characteristics. In this paper, a mixed-method study was developed using 463,983 tweets from early ChatGPT users. We first apply topic modeling to identify the maj or topics and then conduct an extensive qualitative sentiment analysis. We observed that most people were pleased with the tool, but some expressed apprehension about its potential ethical and legal implications. After its launch, however, the fears were largely alleviated as people began to use it and recognize its benefits for personal and business purposes. It is important to be aware of any new technology's possible drawbacks and use it responsibly.},

  abstract={Target detection is a revolutionary advancement in computer vision that provides the ability to identify specific targets in images for a wide variety of applications, including but not limited to video surveillance, face recognition, and autonomous driving. Although target detection has been developed to a high level and can be deployed for applications in several fields, there are still some problems in practice, such as the two-phase detection algorithm has high detection accuracy but slow detection speed, while the one-phase detection algorithm is fast, but its accuracy is poor. We need to combine their respective advantages further for related algorithm research, and we need to reach a balance between detection speed and detection accuracy so that the algorithms can be deployed on edge devices with limited computational power. Knowledge Refinement, as one of the common means of model compression, can solve the above problems, and it reduces the deployment difficulty of the algorithms. In this paper, we summarize the use of knowledge compression on target detection. We conclude the methods mentioned in the paper from an objective and unbiased perspective and suggest possible improvement directions, and we provide an outlook on the future trend of combining distillation learning and target detection. This paper provides a clear overview of the field of target detection and provides an idea of future trends.},

  abstract={The surge in legal text production has amplified the workload for legal professionals, making many tasks repetitive and time-consuming. Furthermore, the complexity and specialized language of legal documents pose challenges not just for those in the legal domain but also for the general public. This emphasizes the potential role and impact of Legal Natural Language Processing (Legal NLP). Although advancements have been made in this domain, particularly after 2015 with the advent of Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs), a systematic exploration of this progress until 2022 is nonexistent. In this research, we perform a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to bridge this gap. We aim to provide a descriptive statistical analysis of the Legal NLP research between 2015 and 2022. Categorize and sub-categorize primary publications based on their research problems. Identify limitations and areas of improvement in current research. Using a robust search methodology across four reputable indexers, we filtered 536 papers down to 75 pivotal articles. Our findings reveal the diverse methods employed for tasks such as Multiclass Classification, Summarization, and Question Answering in the Legal NLP field. We also highlight resources, challenges, and gaps in current methodologies and emphasize the need for curated datasets, ontologies, and a focus on inherent difficulties like data accessibility. As the legal sector gradually embraces Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding the capabilities and limitations of Legal NLP becomes vital for ensuring efficient and ethical application. The research offers insights for both Legal NLP researchers and the broader legal community, advocating for continued advancements in automation while also addressing ethical concerns.},

  title={CSAT: Contrastive Sampling-Aggregating Transformer for Community Detection in Attribute-Missing Networks}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={2},
  pages={2277-2290},
  abstract={Community detection aims to identify dense subgroups of nodes within a network. However, in real-world networks, node attributes are often missing, making traditional methods less effective. In networks with missing attributes, the main challenge of community detection is to deal with the missing attribute information efficiently and use network structure information to make accurate predictions. This article proposes an innovative method called contrastive sampling-aggregating transformer (CSAT) for community detection in attribute-missing networks. CSAT incorporates the contrastive learning principle to capture hidden patterns among nodes and to aggregate information from different samples to create a more robust and accurate methodology for community detection. Specifically, CSAT utilizes a sampling and propagation strategy to obtain different samples and smooth attribute features of the network structure and leverages the Transformer architecture to model the pairwise relationships between nodes. Therefore, our method can address the attribute-missing issue by integrating the auxiliary information from both the network structure and other sources. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate CSAT’s superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods for community detection.},

  abstract={Early skin disease detection is crucial for both effective treatment and the prevention of spreading to others. Neglected Tropical Skin Diseases (skin-NTDs) primarily affect low-income and developing countries, receiving inadequate attention and resources in comparison to other health issues. In this study, an automated system has been developed for detecting five skin-NTDs, capable of recognizing the diseases from raw lesion images without requiring any pre-processing. A dataset was created in the initial phase of the study since no publicly available benchmarks are available. The EfficientNet family of pre-trained models was utilized to train the classifier, and the EfficientNet-B3 was selected based on the experimental results. Additionally, the proposed work has developed a Grad-CAM based visualization technique to identify the most influential regions within images for the classification of specific diseases. The proposed model exhibited an overall classification accuracy of 91.53% on the test data. The proposed work will offer benefits to frontline medical staff and local residents in low-income countries.},

  abstract={In the interconnected world of the Internet, IP geolocation -identifying the geographic location of a device, user, or data source given their IP -plays an essential role in numerous applications and services. Over the years, IP geolocation technology has evolved, and it is now a cornerstone of the digital age. However, attaining accurate IP geolocation is not without its challenges. Our comprehensive survey explores IP geolocation, focusing on emerging challenges in security, data geolocation in the cloud, and coping with proxies and VPNs that are used to hide the real IP geolocation. These topics have gained prominence as organizations grapple with safeguarding the location of sensitive information, complying with data privacy regulations, and adapting to the dynamic digital landscape. By synthesizing research, analyzing industry practices, and exploring trends, we equip readers with a taxonomy and insights into the multifaceted world of geolocation and its vital role in shaping the digital future. This comprehensive survey not only enriches understanding of IP geolocation and its challenges but also provides a roadmap for future research, fostering increased awareness and the development of informed strategies for addressing the evolving landscape of geospatial security on the Internet.},

  title={The Language of Infographics: Toward Understanding Conceptual Metaphor Use in Scientific Storytelling}, 
  year={2025},
  volume={31},
  number={1},
  pages={371-381},
  abstract={We apply an approach from cognitive linguistics by mapping Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) to the visualization domain to address patterns of visual conceptual metaphors that are often used in science infographics. Metaphors play an essential part in visual communication and are frequently employed to explain complex concepts. However, their use is often based on intuition, rather than following a formal process. At present, we lack tools and language for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g., infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains (biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science. This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex scientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory tool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on a spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual metaphors.},

  abstract={The metaverse, known as the next-generation 3D Internet, represents virtual environments that mirror the physical world. It is supported by innovative technologies such as digital twins and extended reality (XR), which elevate user experiences across various fields. However, the metaverse also introduces significant cybersecurity and privacy challenges that remain underexplored. Due to its complex multi-tech infrastructure, the metaverse requires sophisticated, automated, and intelligent cybersecurity measures to mitigate emerging threats effectively. Therefore, this paper is the first to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven cybersecurity techniques for the metaverse, examining academic and industrial perspectives. First, we provide an overview of the metaverse, presenting a detailed system model, diverse use cases, and insights into its current industrial status. We then present attack models and cybersecurity threats derived from the unique characteristics and technologies of the metaverse. Next, we review AI-driven cybersecurity solutions based on three critical aspects: User authentication, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and the security of digital assets, specifically for Blockchain and Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). Finally, we highlight challenges and suggest future research opportunities to enhance metaverse security, privacy, and digital asset transactions.},

The ROUGE score, a widely accepted metric for automated summary assessment, was used to analyze the performance of the trained models. This project involved not only training and optimizing transformer and deep learning models to obtain a comprehensive summary, but also comparing their ROUGE scores to determine which model outperformed the others.

Governments are implementing digital transformation strategies to improve service delivery, citizen participation, and information-sharing mechanisms. South Africa has identified digital skills as a critical challenge to becoming a professional and globally competitive knowledge society. However, the 2016 Global IT Report of the World Economic Forum ranks South Africa 95th out of 139 countries on the skills pillar due to poor education quality in math and science and a lack of effective use of digital opportunities. This paper is based on a PhD study aimed at measuring the digital competence of South African citizens. A unique definition of digital competence has been derived from the literature in pursuit of understanding the characteristics of digital competence. Furthermore, models and frameworks that measure digital competence were evaluated for their suitability to the South African context, which resulted in the selection of the EU DigComp framework.

  abstract={Emerging massive machine-type communications service class needs to support many devices while ensuring that scarce radio resources are utilized efficiently. Non-orthogonal multiple access is proposed to minimize the signaling overhead and optimize resource allocation. However, during the initial access, the base station is presented with the challenge of identifying sparsely active devices in the absence of knowledge about the sparsity and channel state information. The user channels in most practical scenarios have common reflection paths, making them partially correlated, which can be exploited to improve the detection performance at the base station. In this context, we formulate a novel multi-user detection (MUD) problem in spatially correlated Rician channels, which we reformulate as a multi-label classification problem utilizing deep learning techniques. We propose two diverse approaches to tackle this problem: ViT-Net, a vision transformer-based architecture, and FAR-Net, a fully activated deep neural network featuring residual connections. Our analysis highlights the significance of spatial correlation for MUD, which can accord around 13% higher overloading ratio compared to the non-correlated scenario. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in addressing spatial correlation compared to the existing deep learning models.},

  title={FocusCLIP: Focusing on Anomaly Regions by Visual-Text Discrepancies}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Few-shot anomaly detection aims to detect defects with only a limited number of normal samples for training. Recent few-shot methods typically focus on object-level features rather than subtle defects within objects, as pretrained models are generally trained on classification or image-text matching datasets. However, object-level features are often insufficient to detect defects, which are characterized by fine-grained texture variations. To address this, we propose FocusCLIP, which consists of a vision-guided branch and a language-guided branch. FocusCLIP leverages the complementary relationship between visual and text modalities to jointly emphasize discrepancies in fine-grained textures of defect regions. Specifically, we design three modules to mine these discrepancies. In the vision-guided branch, we propose the Bidirectional Self-knowledge Distillation (BSD) structure, which identifies anomaly regions through inconsistent representations and accumulates these discrepancies. Within this structure, the Anomaly Capture Module (ACM) is designed to refine features and detect more comprehensive anomalies by leveraging semantic cues from multi-head self-attention. In the language-guided branch, Multi-level Adversarial Class Activation Mapping (MACAM) utilizes foreground-invariant responses to adversarial text prompts, reducing interference from object regions and further focusing on defect regions. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in few-shot anomaly detection. Additionally, the language-guided branch within FocusCLIP also demonstrates competitive performance in zero-shot anomaly detection, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract={Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) aims to identify fine-grained anomalies from sparse video-level labels, which has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its various applications such as disaster warning and public security. Recent studies typically formulate WS-VAD as a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem. However, they neglect the instance creation process and simply apply a uniform temporal pooling (UTP) operation to obtain the training instances, leading to severe anomaly contamination and dilution. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of the instance modeling procedure and propose two simple yet effective modules, i.e., the dynamic segment merging (DSM) module and the retrieval-augmented anomaly restoration (RA2R) module, to tackle the problem from segment-level and feature-level, respectively. We equip various state-of-the-art WS-VAD models with the proposed methods and conduct thorough experiments on the challenging datasets, e.g., UCF-Crime, and XD-Violence. Results demonstrate the proposed method brings consistent performance improvement and establishes new state-of-the-art.},

  pages={468-475},
  abstract={In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the development of autonomous vehicle (AV) technologies aimed at improving safety in transportation systems. While AVs have been deployed in the real-world to some extent, a full-scale deployment requires AVs to robustly navigate through challenges like heavy rain, snow, low lighting, construction zones and GPS signal loss in tunnels. To be able to handle these specific challenges, an AV must reliably recognize the physical attributes of the environment in which it operates. In this paper, we define context recognition as the task of accurately identifying environmental attributes for an AV to appropriately deal with them. Specifically, we define 24 environmental contexts capturing a variety of weather, lighting, traffic and road conditions that an AV must be aware of. Motivated by the need to recognize environmental contexts, we create a context recognition dataset called DrivingContexts with more than 1.6 million context-query pairs relevant for an AV. Since traditional supervised computer vision approaches do not scale well to a variety of contexts, we propose a framework called ContextVLM that uses vision-language models to detect contexts using zero- and few-shot approaches. ContextVLM is capable of reliably detecting relevant driving contexts with an accuracy of more than 95% on our dataset, while running in real-time on a 4GB Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti GPU on an AV with a latency of 10.5 ms per query.},

  abstract={How a modern radio works, told through mathematics, history, and selected puzzlesThe modern radio is a wonder, and behind that magic is mathematics. In The Mathematical Radio, Paul Nahin explains how radios work, deploying mathematics and historical discussion, accompanied by a steady stream of intriguing puzzles for math buffs to ponder. Beginning with oscillators and circuits, then moving on to AM, FM, and single-sideband radio, Nahin focuses on the elegant mathematics underlying radio technology rather than the engineering. He explores and explains more than a century of key developments, placing them in historical and technological context.Nahin, a prolific author of books on math for the general reader, describes in fascinating detail the mathematical underpinnings of a technology we use daily. He explains and solves, for example, Maxwell’s equations for the electromagnetic field. Readers need only a familarity with advanced high school–level math to follow Nahin’s mathematical discussions. Writing with the nonengineer in mind, Nahin examines topics including impulses in time and frequency, spectrum shifting at the transmitter, the superheterodyne, the physics of single-sideband radio, and FM sidebands. Chapters end with “challenge problems” and an appendix offers solutions, partial answers, and hints. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for the beauty of even the most useful mathematics.},

  abstract={How computational methods can expand how we see, read, and listen to Holocaust testimonyThe Holocaust is one of the most documented—and now digitized—events in human history. Institutions and archives hold hundreds of thousands of hours of audio and video testimony, composed of more than a billion words in dozens of languages, with millions of pieces of descriptive metadata. It would take several lifetimes to engage with these testimonies one at a time. Computational methods could be used to analyze an entire archive—but what are the ethical implications of “listening” to Holocaust testimonies by means of an algorithm? In this book, Todd Presner explores how the digital humanities can provide both new insights and humanizing perspectives for Holocaust memory and history.Presner suggests that it is possible to develop an “ethics of the algorithm” that mediates between the ethical demands of listening to individual testimonies and the interpretative possibilities of computational methods. He delves into thousands of testimonies and witness accounts, focusing on the analysis of trauma, language, voice, genre, and the archive itself. Tracing the affordances of digital tools that range from early, proto-computational approaches to more recent uses of automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, Presner introduces readers to what may be the ultimate expression of these methods: AI-driven testimonies that use machine learning to process responses to questions, offering a user experience that seems to replicate an actual conversation with a Holocaust survivor.With Ethics of the Algorithm, Presner presents a digital humanities argument for how big data models and computational methods can be used to preserve and perpetuate cultural memory.},

  abstract={How a computational framework can account for the successes and failures of human cognitionAt the heart of human intelligence rests a fundamental puzzle: How are we incredibly smart and stupid at the same time? No existing machine can match the power and flexibility of human perception, language, and reasoning. Yet, we routinely commit errors that reveal the failures of our thought processes. What Makes Us Smart makes sense of this paradox by arguing that our cognitive errors are not haphazard. Rather, they are the inevitable consequences of a brain optimized for efficient inference and decision making within the constraints of time, energy, and memory—in other words, data and resource limitations. Framing human intelligence in terms of these constraints, Samuel Gershman shows how a deeper computational logic underpins the “stupid” errors of human cognition.Embarking on a journey across psychology, neuroscience, computer science, linguistics, and economics, Gershman presents unifying principles that govern human intelligence. First, inductive bias: any system that makes inferences based on limited data must constrain its hypotheses in some way before observing data. Second, approximation bias: any system that makes inferences and decisions with limited resources must make approximations. Applying these principles to a range of computational errors made by humans, Gershman demonstrates that intelligent systems designed to meet these constraints yield characteristically human errors.Examining how humans make intelligent and maladaptive decisions, What Makes Us Smart delves into the successes and failures of cognition.},

This has resulted in a significant corpus of hardware Trojan research including Trojan design and benchmarking efforts and development of corresponding metrics and detection and prevention techniques, over the last two decades. In this survey, we first highlight efforts in Trojan design and benchmarking, followed by a cataloging of seminal and recent works in Trojan detection and prevention and their accompanied metrics. Given the volume of literature in this field, this survey considers only pre-silicon techniques. We make this distinction between pre- and post-silicon to properly scope and provide appropriate context into the capabilities of existing hardware Trojan literature. Each major section (design, prevention, and detection) is accompanied by insights, and common pitfalls, which we highlight can be addressed by future research.},

  abstract={Metaverse, as an evolving paradigm of the next-generation Internet, aims to build a fully immersive, hyper spatiotemporal, and self-sustaining virtual shared space for humans to play, work, and socialize. Driven by recent advances in emerging technologies such as extended reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, metaverse is stepping from science fiction to an upcoming reality. However, severe privacy invasions and security breaches (inherited from underlying technologies or emerged in the new digital ecology) of metaverse can impede its wide deployment. At the same time, a series of fundamental challenges (e.g., scalability and interoperability) can arise in metaverse security provisioning owing to the intrinsic characteristics of metaverse, such as immersive realism, hyper spatiotemporality, sustainability, and heterogeneity. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the fundamentals, security, and privacy of metaverse. Specifically, we first investigate a novel distributed metaverse architecture and its key characteristics with ternary-world interactions. Then, we discuss the security and privacy threats, present the critical challenges of metaverse systems, and review the state-of-the-art countermeasures. Finally, we draw open research directions for building future metaverse systems.},

  abstract={From the visionary founder of the Self-Assembly Lab at MIT, a manifesto for the dawning age of active materialsThings in life tend to fall apart. Cars break down. Buildings fall into disrepair. Personal items deteriorate. Yet today's researchers are exploiting newly understood properties of matter to program materials that physically sense, adapt, and fall together instead of apart. These materials open new directions for industrial innovation and challenge us to rethink the way we build and collaborate with our environment. Things Fall Together is a provocative guide to this emerging, often mind-bending reality, presenting a bold vision for harnessing the intelligence embedded in the material world.Drawing on his pioneering work on self-assembly and programmable material technologies, Skylar Tibbits lays out the core, frequently counterintuitive ideas and strategies that animate this new approach to design and innovation. From furniture that builds itself to shoes printed flat that jump into shape to islands that grow themselves, he describes how matter can compute and exhibit behaviors that we typically associate with biological organisms, and challenges our fundamental assumptions about what physical materials can do and how we can interact with them. Intelligent products today often rely on electronics, batteries, and complicated mechanisms. Tibbits offers a different approach, showing how we can design simple and elegant material intelligence that may one day animate and improve itself—and along the way help us build a more sustainable future.Compelling and beautifully designed, Things Fall Together provides an insider's perspective on the materials revolution that lies ahead, revealing the spectacular possibilities for designing active materials that can self-assemble, collaborate, and one day even evolve and design on their own.},

  abstract={An intimate reckoning with aquifer depletion in America's heartlandThe Ogallala aquifer has nourished life on the American Great Plains for millennia. But less than a century of unsustainable irrigation farming has taxed much of the aquifer beyond repair. The imminent depletion of the Ogallala and other aquifers around the world is a defining planetary crisis of our times. Running Out offers a uniquely personal account of aquifer depletion and the deeper layers through which it gains meaning and force.Anthropologist Lucas Bessire journeyed back to western Kansas, where five generations of his family lived as irrigation farmers and ranchers, to try to make sense of this vital resource and its loss. His search for water across the drying High Plains brings the reader face to face with the stark realities of industrial agriculture, eroding democratic norms, and surreal interpretations of a looming disaster. Yet the destination is far from predictable, as the book seeks to move beyond the words and genres through which destruction is often known. Instead, this journey into the morass of eradication offers a series of unexpected discoveries about what it means to inherit the troubled legacies of the past and how we can take responsibility for a more inclusive, sustainable future.An urgent and unsettling meditation on environmental change, Running Out is a revelatory account of family, complicity, loss, and what it means to find your way back home.},

  pages={},
  abstract={The field of computer vision is now a multi-billion dollar enterprise, with its use in surveillance applications driving this large market share. In the last six years, computer vision researchers have started to discuss the risks and harms of some of these systems, mostly using the lens of fairness introduced in the machine learning literature to perform this analysis. While this lens is useful to uncover and mitigate a narrow segment of the harms that can be enacted through computer vision systems, it is only one of the toolkits that researchers have available to uncover and mitigate the harms of the systems they build. In this monograph, a wide range of risks and harms that can be enacted through the development and deployment of computer vision systems are discussed, in addition to some existing technical approaches to mitigating these harms and the shortcomings of these mitigation strategies. Thereafter, computer vision researchers are introduced to harm mitigation strategies proposed by journalists, human rights activists, individuals harmed by computer vision systems, and researchers in disciplines ranging from sociology to physics. The monograph concludes by listing principles that researchers can follow to build community-rooted computer vision tools in the public interest. The authors hope that this monograph can serve as a starting point for researchers exploring the harms of current computer vision systems and attempting to steer the field into community-rooted work.},

  pages={},
  abstract={A breathtakingly illustrated look at botanical spirals and the scientists who puzzled over themCharles Darwin was driven to distraction by plant spirals, growing so exasperated that he once begged a friend to explain the mystery “if you wish to save me from a miserable death.” The legendary naturalist was hardly alone in feeling tormented by these patterns. Plant spirals captured the gaze of Leonardo da Vinci and became Alan Turing’s final obsession. This book tells the stories of the physicists, mathematicians, and biologists who found themselves magnetically drawn to Fibonacci spirals in plants, seeking an answer to why these beautiful and seductive patterns occur in botanical forms as diverse as pine cones, cabbages, and sunflowers.Do Plants Know Math? takes you down through the centuries to explore how great minds have been captivated and mystified by Fibonacci patterns in nature. It presents a powerful new geometrical solution, little known outside of scientific circles, that sheds light on why regular and irregular spiral patterns occur. Along the way, the book discusses related plant geometries such as fractals and the fascinating way that leaves are folded inside of buds. Your neurons will crackle as you begin to see the connections. This book will inspire you to look at botanical patterns—and the natural world itself—with new eyes.Featuring hundreds of gorgeous color images, Do Plants Know Math? includes a dozen creative hands-on activities and even spiral-plant recipes, encouraging readers to explore and celebrate these beguiling patterns for themselves.},

  abstract={In recent years, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted to cyber-threat protection of computer systems which is one of the most critical cybersecurity tasks for single users and businesses since even a single attack can result in compromised data and sufficient losses. Massive losses and frequent attacks dictate the need for accurate and timely detection methods. Current static and dynamic methods do not provide efficient detection, especially when dealing with zero-day attacks. For this reason, big data analytics and machine intelligence-based techniques can be used. This book brings together researchers in the field of big data analytics and intelligent systems for cyber threat intelligence CTI and key data to advance the mission of anticipating, prohibiting, preventing, preparing, and responding to internal security. The wide variety of topics it presents offers readers multiple perspectives on various disciplines related to big data analytics and intelligent systems for cyber threat intelligence applications.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled IoT is a significant paradigm that has been proliferating to new heights in recent years. IoT is a smart technology in which the physical objects or the things that are ubiquitously around us are networked and linked to the internet to deliver new services and enhance efficiency. The primary objective of the IoT is to connect all the physical objects or the things of the world under a common infrastructure, allowing humans to control them and get timely, frequent updates on their status. These things or devices connected to IoT generate, gather and process a massive volume of binary data. This massive volume of data generated from these devices is analyzed and learned by AI algorithms and techniques that aid in providing users with better services. Thus, AI-enabled IoT or artificial IoT (AIoT) is a hybrid technology that merges AI with IoT and is capable of simplifying complicated and strenuous tasks with ease and efficiency. The various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in IoT are necessary to ensure the IoT network’s improved security and confidentiality. Furthermore, this paper also surveys the various architectures that form the backbone of IoT and AIoT. Moreover, the myriad state-of-the-art ML and DL-based approaches for securing IoT, including detecting anomalies/intrusions, authentication and access control, attack detection and mitigation, preventing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and analyzing malware in IoT, are also enlightened. In addition, this work also reviews the role of AIoT in optimizing network efficiency, securing IoT infrastructures, and addressing key challenges. Furthermore, it explores cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, 6G-enabled AIoT, federated learning (FL), and hyperdimensional (HD) computing, indicating their potential in advancing IoT and AIoT-driven applications within sectors like healthcare, autonomous systems, and industrial automation. Therefore, based on the plethora of prevailing significant works, the objective of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive survey that expounds on AIoT in terms of security, architecture, applications, emerging technologies, and challenges.},

  pages={2490-2540},
  abstract={Around 2020, 5G began its commercialization journey, and discussions about the next-generation networks (such as 6G) emerged. Researchers predict that 6G networks will have higher bandwidth, coverage, reliability, energy efficiency, and lower latency, and will be an integrated “human-centric” network system powered by artificial intelligence (AI). This 6G network will lead to many real-time automated decisions, ranging from network resource allocation to collision avoidance for self-driving cars. However, there is a risk of losing control over decision-making due to the high-speed, data-intensive AI decision-making that may go beyond designers’ and users’ comprehension. To mitigate this risk, explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to enhance the transparency of the black-box AI decision-making process. This paper surveys the application of XAI towards the upcoming 6G age, including 6G technologies (such as intelligent radio and zero-touch network management) and 6G use cases (such as industry 5.0). Additionally, the paper summarizes the lessons learned from recent attempts and outlines important research challenges in applying XAI for 6G use cases soon.},

  year={2024},

  pages={2460-2477},
  abstract={Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art approach to model and draw inferences from large scale graph-structured data in various application settings such as social networking. The primary goal of a GNN is to learn an embedding for each graph node in a dataset that encodes both the node features and the local graph structure around the node.Prior work has shown that GNNs are prone to model extraction attacks. Model extraction attacks and defenses have been explored extensively in other non-graph settings. While detecting or preventing model extraction appears to be difficult, deterring them via effective ownership verification techniques offer a potential defense. In non-graph settings, fingerprinting models, or the data used to build them, have shown to be a promising approach toward ownership verification.We present GrOVe, a state-of-the-art GNN model fingerprinting scheme that, given a target model and a suspect model, can reliably determine if the suspect model was trained independently of the target model or if it is a surrogate of the target model obtained via model extraction. We show that GrOVe can distinguish between surrogate and independent models even when the independent model uses the same training dataset and architecture as the original target model.Using six benchmark datasets and three model architectures, we show that GrOVe consistently achieves low falsepositive and false-negative rates. We demonstrate that GrOVe is robust against known fingerprint evasion techniques while remaining computationally efficient.},

  title={What is Skill? (and why does it matter?)}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-9},
  abstract={This Research-to-Practice Full Paper seeks to investigate the concept of Skill within a Competency Framework, such as that described by the CC2020 document. The notion of skill is fundamental to modern educational discourse. As educators, we strive, not only to impart knowledge, but to help students acquire the skills that they need to flourish in the modern academic and professional environments. We admire skillful practitioners and strive to become more skilled at what we do, recognising that skill is tied to an aesthetic sense - that there is something attractive and deeply satisfying about the process and output of skillful practice. Together with knowledge and disposition, the term is also used to denote one of the constituent components of competence. In computing, for example, the CC2020 document proposes curricular development models which promote skills as key ontological elements and emphasises skill acquisition as a major focus in the educational process. While this is undoubtedly an important, evolutionary development in discipline-based pedagogical practice, we feel that there are still foundational questions to be asked about precisely what is meant by definitional terms that form the core vocabulary of this approach. In this paper, we look at the notion of skill and provide a conceptual analysis which tries to distinguish it from other related ideas. We provide an overview of how skill has been seen historically as both a philosophical and sociological construct and what this means for using the term in educational theory. We examine how to usefully define skill, discuss the part it plays in teaching and assessment, and make recommendations for how it can be viewed operationally within a competency framework, such as that proposed by CC2020.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Falsification, whose aim is to detect unsafe behaviors of cyber-physical systems (CPS) that violate signal temporal logic (STL) specifications, has been actively investigated in the past decade. Although numerous falsification approaches have been proposed, the falsification community suffers from a shortage of benchmarks that hinders a thorough assessment of those falsification approaches. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing an automated approach for generating falsification benchmarks. Our approach is data-driven: firstly, we generate different time-variant traces (acting as system output traces) that satisfy a given STL specification, and we associate these with corresponding system input traces; then, we use these input and output traces to train an LSTM model that generalizes them. These models can serve as benchmarks for assessing falsification approaches against the given specification. In the experimental evaluation, we validate the generated models by measuring their ability to differentiate the performance of different falsification approaches. Our generated models expose strengths and weaknesses of all the considered falsification approaches, which was not achieved by benchmarks currently used in the falsification community.

  pages={1-20},
  abstract={Federated Foundation Models (FedFMs) represent a distributed learning paradigm that fuses general competences of foundation models as well as privacy-preserving capabilities of federated learning. This combination allows the large foundation models and the small local domain models at the remote clients to learn from each other in a teacher-student learning setting. This paper provides a comprehensive summary of the ten challenging problems inherent in FedFMs, encompassing foundational theory, utilization of private data, continual learning, unlearning, Non-IID and graph data, bidirectional knowledge transfer, incentive mechanism design, game mechanism design, model watermarking, and efficiency. The ten challenging problems manifest in five pivotal aspects: “Foundational Theory,” which aims to establish a coherent and unifying theoretical framework for FedFMs. “Data,” addressing the difficulties in leveraging domain-specific knowledge from private data while maintaining privacy; “Heterogeneity,” examining variations in data, model, and computational resources across clients; “Security and Privacy,” focusing on defenses against malicious attacks and model theft; and “Efficiency,” highlighting the need for improvements in training, communication, and parameter efficiency. For each problem, we offer a clear mathematical definition on the objective function, analyze existing methods, and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. This in-depth exploration aims to advance the theoretical foundations of FedFMs, guide practical implementations, and inspire future research to overcome these obstacles, thereby enabling the robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving FedFMs in various real-world applications.},

You’re not alone. AI is everywhere—and few things are surrounded by so much hype, misinformation, and misunderstanding. In AI Snake Oil, computer scientists Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor cut through the confusion to give you an essential understanding of how AI works and why it often doesn’t, where it might be useful or harmful, and when you should suspect that companies are using AI hype to sell AI snake oil—products that don’t work, and probably never will.While acknowledging the potential of some AI, such as ChatGPT, AI Snake Oil uncovers rampant misleading claims about the capabilities of AI and describes the serious harms AI is already causing in how it’s being built, marketed, and used in areas such as education, medicine, hiring, banking, insurance, and criminal justice. The book explains the crucial differences between types of AI, why organizations are falling for AI snake oil, why AI can’t fix social media, why AI isn’t an existential risk, and why we should be far more worried about what people will do with AI than about anything AI will do on its own. The book also warns of the dangers of a world where AI continues to be controlled by largely unaccountable big tech companies.By revealing AI’s limits and real risks, AI Snake Oil will help you make better decisions about whether and how to use AI at work and home.},

  abstract={By interacting, synchronizing, and cooperating with its physical counterpart in real time, digital twin (DT) is promised to promote an intelligent, predictive, and optimized modern city. Via interconnecting massive physical entities and their virtual twins with inter-twin and intra-twin communications, the Internet of DTs (IoDT) enables free data exchange, dynamic mission cooperation, and efficient information aggregation for composite insights across vast physical/virtual entities. However, as IoDT incorporates various cutting-edge technologies to spawn the new ecology, severe known/unknown security flaws, and privacy invasions of IoDT hinder its wide deployment. Besides, the intrinsic characteristics of IoDT, such as decentralized structure, information-centric routing, and semantic communications, entail critical challenges for security service provisioning in IoDT. To this end, this article presents an in-depth review of the IoDT with respect to system architecture, enabling technologies, and security/privacy issues. Specifically, we first explore a novel distributed IoDT architecture with cyber–physical interactions and discuss its key characteristics and communication modes. Afterward, we investigate the taxonomy of security and privacy threats in IoDT, discuss the key research challenges, and review the state-of-the-art defense approaches. Finally, we point out the new trends and open research directions related to IoDT.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates the integration between objects and different sensors to provide communication among them without human intervention. However, the extensive demand for IoT and its various applications has continued to grow, coupled with the need to achieve foolproof security requirements. IoT produces a vast amount of data under several constraints such as low processor, power, and memory. These constraints, along with the invaluable data produced by IoT devices, make IoT vulnerable to various security attacks. This paper presents an overview of IoT, its well-known system architecture, enabling technologies, and discusses security challenges and goals. Furthermore, we analyze security vulnerabilities and provide state-of-the-art security taxonomy. The taxonomy of the most relevant and current IoT security attacks is presented for application, network, and physical layers. While most other surveys studied one of the areas of security measures, this study considers and reports on the most advanced security countermeasures within the areas of autonomic, encryption, and learning-based approaches. Additionally, we uncover security challenges that may be met by the research community regarding security implementation in heterogeneous IoT environment. Finally, we provide different visions about possible security solutions and future research directions.},

  abstract={Malware poses a severe threat to cyber security. Attackers use malware to achieve their malicious purposes, such as unauthorized access, stealing confidential data, blackmailing, etc. Machine learning-based defense methods are applied to classify malware examples. However, such methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers aim to generate adversarial examples that can evade detection. Defenders also develop various approaches to enhance the robustness of malware classifiers against adversarial attacks. Both attackers and defenders evolve in the continuous confrontation of malware classification. In this paper, we firstly summarize a unified malware classification framework. Then, based on the framework, we systematically survey the Defense-Attack-Enhanced-Defense process and provide a comprehensive review of (i) machine learning-based malware classification, (ii) adversarial attacks on malware classifiers, and (iii) robust malware classification. Finally, we highlight the main challenges faced by both attackers and defenders and discuss some promising future work directions.},

  abstract={ChatGPT has been acknowledged as a powerful tool that can radically boost productivity across a wide range of industries. It reveals potential in cybersecurity-related tasks such as social engineering. Nevertheless, this possibility raises important concerns regarding the thin line separating moral use of this technology from its harmful usage. It is imperative to address the challenges of distinguishing between legitimate and malevolent use of ChatGPT. This research paper investigates the many concerns of ChatGPT in cybersecurity, privacy and enterprise settings. It covers harmful attacker uses such as injecting malicious prompts, testing brute force attacks, preparing and developing ransomware attacks, etc. Defenders’ proactive activities are also addressed, highlighting ChatGPT’s significance in security operations and threat intelligence. These defensive operations are classified based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology cybersecurity framework. They involve analyzing configuration files, inquiring about authoritative server, improving security in various systems, etc. Moreover, secure enterprise practices and mitigations spread through five classes are proposed, with an emphasis on clear usage standards and guidelines establishment, personally identifiable information protection, adversarial attack prevention, watermarking generated content, etc. An integrated discussion digs into the interaction of offensive and defensive applications, covering ethical and practical concerns. Future attacks are also discussed, along with potential solutions such as content filtering and collaboration. Finally, a comparative analysis with recent research on ChatGPT security concerns is directed. The paper provides a thorough framework to comprehend the range of implications associated with ChatGPT, enabling the navigation of cybersecurity and privacy challenges.},

  volume={11},

  pages={35965-35983},
  abstract={Routing techniques for analog and radio-frequency (A/RF) integrated circuit (IC) design automation have been proposed in the literature for over three decades. On those, an extensive set of geometric constraints have already been covered as surrogates for routing quality, but also, performance-related criteria were progressively included. However, as A/RF design moved into advanced integration technology nodes, the increasing number of design rules/constraints, wire resistance, congestion, and interwire parasitic growth is constantly challenging existing automatic routing techniques and keeping pressure on their improvement. Fortunately, recent developments in modern workstations’ capabilities allowed the growth of sophisticated routing processes, including some assisted by the latest machine and deep learning methods, offering unprecedented solutions for the automation of this task. Still, as the correlation between routing-induced parasitic structures and the circuit’s functional behavior is far from simple, computational-intensive parasitic-inclusive and layout-aware synthesis techniques have also been proposed, where automatic routing techniques play a decisive role. This paper conducts an extensive review of A/RF IC routing techniques, from the digitally-inspired earliest approaches to state-of-the-art developments, providing a complete and comprehensive guide for circuit designers and design automation developers while defining research lines to facilitate more activities within this field.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) algorithms are now widely used to tackle computational problems in diverse domains. In biomedicine, the rapidly growing amounts of experimental data increasingly necessitate the use of ML to discern complex data patterns. However, biomedical data is often considered sensitive, and the privacy of individuals behind the data is increasingly put at risk as a result. Traditional methods such as anonymization and pseudonymization are not always applicable and have limited effectiveness with respect to risk mitigation. Privacy researchers are actively developing alternative approaches to privacy protection, including strategies based on cryptography, such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. This paper discusses recent advances in biomedical applications of these privacy techniques. We first review the key privacy techniques, then provide an overview of their applications in biomedical machine learning. Finally, we highlight the remaining challenges of current approaches and suggest directions for future work.},

  abstract={The rapid growth of intelligent sensing capabilities and super computation power in 6G mobile communication systems has facilitated their application in diverse domains such as smart health, smart factories, and the industrial Internet of Things. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), as a core technology, has merged with artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent connectivity, leading to a paradigm shift in traditional communication modes. This paper presents a visionary design for an ISAC-oriented unified IoT architecture that integrates software-defined communication and super-intelligent agents. By leveraging dynamic adaptability, self-learning, and optimization, the ISAC system can intelligently and flexibly respond to evolving requirements and environments. The architecture is redefined into three layers: the hardware layer, the omniscient layer, and the application layer. Furthermore, a retrospective survey of ISAC technology development over the past decade is conducted, highlighting new design principles for AI-empowered networks and multi-modals that support “intelligent connectivity" across various application scenarios and reinforce the security of ISAC. This paper categorizes the related works according to the different layer structures of the proposed architecture, and some important physical and machine learning models are introduced. Additionally, we summarize the current technological bottlenecks associated with ISAC and propose future research directions and potential solutions that lay the foundation for the future development of secure and intelligent communication networks.},

  abstract={How do we evaluate whether computational creativity systems are doing creative things, or in the language of distributed creativity, are effective and possibly active contributors in creative production? The radical multi-disciplinarity of computational creativity invites a wide range of methods for answering such questions. In engineering and computer science it is often the case that one can specify an objective goal for an AI system. In many creativity-related subtasks this may also be the case. Training a neural network to recognize objects in images requires that we have a dataset of annotated images, meaning that we necessarily have the information required to know exactly how well the system is performing&#x2014;at least at the given subtask, if not at the wider objective of contributing to a creative task. Meanwhile, human-computer interaction tasks require evaluation of users&#x0027; responses, and although this is less concrete, data&#x2014;both qualitative and quantitative&#x2014;can be gathered about the system&#x0027;s performance. In other cases, practice-based programmer-artists make work and self-evaluate. In the latter, the evidence becomes vaguer still, but the situation is largely similar to the human-computer interaction context. Systems that generate creative outputs can be investigated using all of these evaluation scenarios and others. A scenario that is somewhat more specific to computational creativity is where people are asked to evaluate the aesthetic quality of the system&#x0027;s output or to otherwise evaluate whether they believe the system to be creative or humanlike.},

  abstract={Nowadays, scholars dedicate a substantial amount of their work to the querying and browsing of increasingly large collections of research papers on the Internet. In parallel, the recent surge of novel interdisciplinary approaches in science requires scholars to acquire competencies in new fields for which they may lack the necessary vocabulary to formulate adequate queries. This problem, together with the issue of information overload, poses new challenges in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and visualization design that call for a rapid response from the scientific community. In this respect, we report on a novel visualization scheme that enables the exploration of research paper collections via the analysis of semantic proximity relationships found in author-assigned keywords. Our proposal replaces traditional string queries with a bag-of-words (BoW) extracted from a user-generated auxiliary corpus that captures the intentionality of the research. Continuing along the lines established by other authors in the fields of literature-based discovery (LBD), NLP, and visual analytics (VA), we combine novel advances in the fields of NLP with visual network analysis techniques to offer scholars a perspective of the target corpus that better fits their research interests. To highlight the advantages of our proposal, we conduct two experiments employing a collection of visualization research papers and an auxiliary cross-domain BoW. Here, we showcase how our visualization can be used to maximize the effectiveness of a browsing session by enhancing the language acquisition task, which allows for effectively extracting knowledge that is in line with the users' previous expectations.},

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IIoT by investigating its significant applications in mobile networks, as well as its associated security and privacy issues. Specifically, we explore and discuss the roles of IIoT in a wide range of key application domains, from smart healthcare and smart cities to smart transportation and smart industries. Through such extensive discussions, we investigate important security issues in IIoT networks, where network attacks, confidentiality, integrity, and intrusion are analyzed, along with a discussion of potential countermeasures. Privacy issues in IIoT networks were also surveyed and discussed, including data, location, and model privacy leakage. Finally, we outline several key challenges and highlight potential research directions in this important area.},

  year={2022},
  volume={3},
  number={},
  pages={464-495},
  abstract={We study the performance of Machine Learning (ML) classification techniques. Leveraging the theory of large deviations, we provide the mathematical conditions for a ML classifier to exhibit error probabilities that vanish exponentially, say $\exp (-n\,I)$, where $n$ is the number of informative observations available for testing (or another relevant parameter, such as the size of the target in an image) and $I$ is the error rate. Such conditions depend on the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the cumulant-generating function of the Data-Driven Decision Function (D3F, i.e., what is thresholded before the final binary decision is made) learned in the training phase. As such, the D3F and the related error rate $I$ depend on the given training set. The conditions for the exponential convergence can be verified and tested numerically exploiting the available dataset or a synthetic dataset generated according to the underlying statistical model. Coherently with the large deviations theory, we can also establish the convergence of the normalized D3F statistic to a Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, approximate error probability curves $\zeta _{n} \exp (-n\,I)$ are provided, thanks to the refined asymptotic derivation, where $\zeta _{n}$ represents the most representative sub-exponential terms of the error probabilities. Leveraging the refined asymptotic, we are able to compute an accurate analytical approximation of the classification performance for both the regimes of small and large values of $n$. Theoretical findings are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations and by the use of real-world data, acquired by an X-band maritime radar system for surveillance.},

  abstract={The booming development of deep learning applications and services heavily relies on large deep learning models and massive data in the cloud. However, cloud-based deep learning encounters challenges in meeting the application requirements of responsiveness, adaptability, and reliability. Edge-based and end-based deep learning enables rapid, near real-time analysis and response, but edge nodes and end devices usually have limited resources to support large models. This necessitates the integration of end, edge, and cloud computing technologies to combine their different advantages. Despite the existence of numerous studies on edge-cloud collaboration, a comprehensive survey for end-edge-cloud computing-enabled deep learning is needed to review the current status and point out future directions. Therefore, this paper: 1) analyzes the collaborative elements within the end-edge-cloud computing system for deep learning, and proposes collaborative training, inference, and updating methods and mechanisms for deep learning models under the end-edge-cloud collaboration framework. 2) provides a systematic investigation of the key enabling technologies for end-edge-cloud collaborative deep learning, including model compression, model partition, and knowledge transfer. 3) highlights six open issues to stimulate continuous research efforts in the field of end-edge-cloud deep learning.},

  abstract={Cryptocurrency money laundering is a pressing issue, as it not only facilitates and hides criminal activities but also disrupts markets and the overall financial system. To respond this challenge, researchers are trying to develop robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) frameworks. These efforts play a crucial role in promoting societal welfare by mitigating the impact of criminal activities. This paper explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for classifying Bitcoin transactions. The research specifically employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), the Chebyshev spatial convolutional neural networks, and GraphSAGE networks. Based on the dataset analysis, we experiment with different subsets of features. Our findings suggest that the use of Graph Neural Network convolutions, combined with a final linear layer and skip connections, allow for an improvement in the state-of-the-art results, especially when Chebyshev and GATv2 convolutions are used.},

  abstract={Data visualization plays a critical role in both understanding data, i.e. in the analyst's interpretation of the results of the computations made on the data, and in conveying that understanding. Historically, the emergence of visualization software has greatly facilitated and spread the use of data visualization. In the fields of human–machine interfaces and ergonomics, which are concerned with data visualization and are derived in particular from cognitive sciences, visualization can be evaluated on a measurable readability criterion. Revealing the epistemic value of data entails both giving meaning to certain signs and discarding others. In the digital context, design is first associated with what is visible on the screen: the graphical user interface. It is thus assimilated to a work of graphic creation (or modification), which consists of making aesthetic an already existing interface created by the developers.},

  year={2018},

  abstract={Any design process involves an imaginative act, a picturing of the world as other than it is. Fiction has long played a part in design research in the form of scenarios, personas, sketches, paper-based prototypes, simulations, prototypes, and speculative design. The term “design fiction” has been recently adopted to describe more elaborate and detailed representations of products and services that do not exist yet. Design fiction is an emerging practice and there are several competing definitions and forms. Research Fiction and Thought Experiments in Design traces design fiction from the Italian radical design of the 1960s through British Art Schools in the late 1990s to contemporary adaptations of the practice by companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Design fiction is now produced regularly by individuals launching Kickstarter campaigns, corporations selling visions of future products and governments imagining new digital services. But there is little agreement about the status of such fictions: what constitutes a good fiction? How does fiction relate to research? In what sense does fiction contribute to existing knowledge? Although fiction can sometimes result in accurate prediction, this is not its main value. It is rather the creation of ambiguous artefacts that help us think carefully about emerging technologies and their potential impact. Fiction may seem to be the antithesis of empirical enquiry but it is often employed in the form of “thought experiments” in Physics, Mathematics, Ethics and Philosophy. Research Fiction and Thought Experiments in Design argues that design fiction can also be considered as a form of thought experiment. Excerpts from a fictional Wikipedia article about Valdis Ozols, a Latvian historian and author writing design fiction in the 1940s, precede each section as think pieces about the nature and value of fiction. The text is illustrated with pages from a fictional design workbook written in an invented language.},

However, evaluating the effectiveness of these systems presents a complex scientific challenge, rooted in the difficulty of assessing a system’s overall effectiveness in assisting users to complete tasks through interactive support, and by the substantial variation in user behaviour and preferences. This monograph focuses on providing a thorough understanding of user simulation techniques designed specifically for evaluation purposes. The authors begin with a background of information access system evaluation and explore the diverse applications of user simulation. Subsequently, they systematically review the major research progress in user simulation, covering both general frameworks for designing user simulators, utilizing user simulation for evaluation, and specific models and algorithms for simulating user interactions with search engines, recommender systems, and conversational assistants. Realizing that user simulation is an interdisciplinary research topic, whenever possible, the authors establish connections with related fields, including machine learning, dialogue systems, user modelling, and economics. This monograph provides a systematic review of user simulation techniques aimed at giving designers methods for successfully evaluating and improving modern information access systems.},

  abstract={A revelatory tale of how the human brain develops, from conception to birth and beyondBy the time a baby is born, its brain is equipped with billions of intricately crafted neurons wired together through trillions of interconnections to form a compact and breathtakingly efficient supercomputer. Zero to Birth takes you on an extraordinary journey to the very edge of creation, from the moment of an egg’s fertilization through each step of a human brain’s development in the womb—and even a little beyond.As pioneering experimental neurobiologist W. A. Harris guides you through the process of how the brain is built, he takes up the biggest questions that scientists have asked about the developing brain, describing many of the thrilling discoveries that were foundational to our current understanding. He weaves in a remarkable evolutionary story that begins billions of years ago in the Proterozoic eon, when multicellular animals first emerged from single-cell organisms, and reveals how the growth of a fetal brain over nine months reflects the brain’s evolution through the ages. Our brains have much in common with those of other animals, and Harris offers an illuminating look at how comparative animal studies have been crucial to understanding what makes a human brain human.An unforgettable chronicle of one of nature’s greatest achievements, Zero to Birth describes how the brain’s incredible feat of orchestrated growth ensures that every brain is unique, and how breakthroughs at the frontiers of science are helping us to decode many traits that only reveal themselves later in life.},

  abstract={The diverse requirements of next-generation communication systems necessitate awareness, flexibility, and intelligence as essential building blocks of future wireless networks. The awareness can be obtained from the radio signals in the environment using wireless sensing and radio environment mapping (REM) methods. This is, however, accompanied by threats such as eavesdropping, manipulation, and disruption posed by malicious attackers. To this end, this work analyzes the wireless sensing and radio environment awareness mechanisms, highlighting their vulnerabilities and provides solutions for mitigating them. As an example, the different threats to REM and its consequences in a vehicular communication scenario are described. Furthermore, the use of REM for securing communications is discussed and future directions regarding sensing/REM security are highlighted.},

  abstract={Gesture recognition is an ideal means of interaction because it allows users not to have to make contact with any surface, which is a safe and hygienic means, especially in the pandemic situation that is occurring worldwide. However, gesture recognition is not a new discipline and it has been researched for many years but this type of interaction has not succeeded in replacing the keyboard and mouse. It is very useful to know about the advances that are being made with artificial intelligence in gesture recognition to be able to perform a more robust and reliable gesture recognition with a low response time. As it is, deep learning is being integrated into various areas to increase improvement in performance and one such area is artificial intelligence. In this way, there is the possibility that in the future the recognition of gestures will be a viable option as a means of daily interaction for the user and the main objective of this paper is to contribute to that process. For this reason, this study has analyzed 571 papers related to gesture recognition and artificial intelligence. This analysis has extracted relevant information related to scientific production, such as the most productive authors and journals or the most pertinent articles on the subject. Furthermore, we have developed our own model, which shows the relationship between the types of gesture recognition and the artificial intelligence techniques that have been applied for this task.},
