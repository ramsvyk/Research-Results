  abstract={Industrial regulation to protect privacy, intellectual property and proprietary information often restricts data sharing - an important prerequisite for developing services in the digital economy. Social media data is publicly available for data mining but requires intensive cleaning and harmonisation before analysis. This paper reveals the process of semantic sensing to convert social network tweets into meaningful insights. Our research question is: how to realise semantic sensing for data innovation? We use design science research to develop an artefact-ontology that collects tweets by pet owners talking about their itchy pet into knowledge graphs, including symptoms, location, breed, timestamp and potential cause and converts them into a thematic map of the regional occurrence of symptoms and potential treatment needs, providing vital information for data innovation. The semantic engine can predict potential causes of itching from the tweet, so a Chatbot may contact the pet owner, inviting them to a veterinary screening. Animal health and pharma companies can use this information to position their services. Our theoretical contribution is a process of semantic sensing, which is a vital part of dynamic capability. Although limited to animal health, the results could be transferred to other contexts.},

  volume={43},
  number={10},
  pages={3102-3115},
  abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) intellectual property (IP) models must be kept undisclosed to avoid revealing trade secrets. Recent works have devised machine learning techniques that leverage on side-channel information leakage of the target platform to reverse engineer DNN architectures. However, these works fail to perform successful attacks on DNNs that have undergone performance optimizations (i.e., operator fusion) using DNN compilers, e.g., Apache tensor virtual machine (TVM). We propose a two-phase attack framework to infer the layer sequences of optimized DNNs through side-channel information leakage. In the first phase, we use a recurrent network with multihead attention components to learn the intra and interlayer fusion patterns from GPU traces of TVM-optimized DNNs, in order to accurately predict the operation distribution. The second phase uses a model to learn the run-time temporal correlations between operations and layers, which enables the prediction of layer sequence. An encoding strategy is proposed to overcome the convergence issues faced by existing learning-based methods when inferring the layer sequences of optimized DNNs. Extensive experiments show that our learning-based framework outperforms state-of-the-art DNN model extraction techniques. Our framework is also the first to effectively reverse engineer both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using side-channel leakage.},

  pages={1669-1676},
  abstract={Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large-scale corpora and excel in numerous general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question answering (QA). Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={The exorbitant cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it essential to protect the models from illegal copying and unauthorized usage. Recent attempts at LLM protection utilize black-box watermarking schemes, which embed distinctive input-output mapping (i.e., trigger set) directly into the models. However, most of them construct trigger inputs by injecting abnormal characters into normal text, which can easily be filtered out by unauthorized users, leading to a failure in watermark verification. In this paper, we propose a novel filtering-resistant LLM watermarking scheme, which takes advantage of imperceptible text styles to trigger the watermark. To achieve this, we adopt a trigger generation network to transform normal text into stylized sentences, which are assigned a specific watermarking label to build the trigger set. We then fine-tune the LLMs on both the trigger sets and clean samples for watermark embedding and performance stabilization. To boost watermark accuracy, we further propose a feature separation loss term to distinguish between normal and trigger inputs. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme for resisting the filtering attack.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Extracting different types of war events from ancient Chinese literature is significant, as war is an important factor in driving the development of Chinese history. The existing trend of event extraction models utilizes template-based generative approaches, which do not take into account the brevity and obscurity of ancient Chinese, as well as the diversity of templates for similar event types. In this paper, we propose a novel Knowledge Graph-based generative event extraction framework with a self-Adaptive Prompt (KGAP) for ancient Chinese war. Specifically, we construct a self-adaptive prompt, which considers its unique trigger words for different types of wars and is designed to solve the problem of the similarity in events. Moreover, we construct a semantic knowledge graph of ancient literature, assisting the pre-trained language model to better understand the ancient Chinese text. Since there is no public dataset for the ancient Chinese event extraction task, we provide an event extraction dataset and conduct experiments on it. Experimental results show that our model is more state-of-the-art than both the classification-based and generative-based methods for event extraction in ancient Chinese literature.},

  abstract={The primary goal of the proposed study is to measure a student’s Emotional Quotient (EQ) for job placement and to correlate the EQ with the ability of the student to survive in the industry. EQ is expected to be influenced by several demographic factors such as age, gender, academic performance, location, parental education, parental income, and family structure. However, the previous studies did not consider these factors. To validate the correlation of demographic factors with EQ, developed a data set considering the above-mentioned factors followed by designing several Machine Learning (ML) based ensemble techniques. Ratings for each parameter ranged from 1 to 10. Based on that, evaluating the results to choose the best approach. The primary goal of this inquiry was to identify the factors other than academic performance that prompt a student to get hired by a company more quickly. The final grade for all students is determined by ascertaining a student’s emotional and intellectual ability. The fundamental contribution of this study is the establishment of a student’s emotional calculation, along with an explanation of how to evaluate it, the advantages of such a concept, its psychometric validity, and its difficulties. The background and variety of validation studies will show how measurements can accurately and rigorously evaluate the behavioral level of EQ.},

Using data from existing benchmarks (ISCAS85-89, TrustHub) and synthetic data generated with Large Language Models (LLM), a dataset of 3,808 instances was used in this research. The approach using TF-IDF and Decision Tree (DT) achieved 97.26%, surpassing the state of the art. The use of LLMs with prompt optimization achieved a recall of 99%, minimizing false negatives.

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Modernity is a social, cultural, or historical descriptor for a certain type of society or set of social arrangements. It is a contentious and disputed term, often understood implicitly. It is a way of describing and classifying highly complex, dynamic, and emergent aggregate social phenomena, and so dramatically simplifies such contexts. However, the language of modernity remains attractive to commentators, academics, and policymakers. In this monograph, the author reviews the literature that characterises what is called digital modernity. Digital modernity narratives focus on the possibilities of the data gathered by an ambient data infrastructure, enabled by ubiquitous devices such as the smartphone, and activities such as social networking and e-commerce. It is characterised by (1) a subjunctive outlook where people’s choices can be anticipated and improved upon, (2) the valorisation of disruptive innovation on demand, and (3) control provided by data analysis within a virtual realm that can be extended and applied to the physical world. The author explored the synergies and tensions between these three aspects as well as the opportunities for and dilemmas posed by misinformation. The author identifies five principles that emerge from the study of relevant texts and business models and concludes by contrasting digital modernity with other theories of the 21st century information society. Narratives of digital modernity are useful because they help explain the development of technology. It matters because many influential people accept, and often generate, the digital modernity narrative. Given digital modernity’s strong association with the Web, it is a central topic for Web Science as the interdisciplinary study of the World Wide Web from the technological, social, and individual points of view.},

  title={Information Bottleneck based Self-distillation: Boosting Lightweight Network for Real-world Super-Resolution}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Most existing single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods focus on addressing predefined uniform degradations, such as bicubic. However, these methods often perform poorly in real-world scenarios due to complicated and varying realistic degradations. In this paper, we propose a novel information bottle-neck-based self-distillation method (IBSD) to boost lightweight networks for real-world image super-resolution. The proposed IBSD leverages the principle of information bottleneck to guide SR networks to learn invariant correlations from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) across various degradations, thereby improving their generalization capacity. Specifically, the target super-resolution network (i.e., student) is interpreted as a Markov chain, and the distillation process is carried out through two modules. Mutual information (MI) estimation networks are used to quantify the mutual information between adjacent nodes within the Markov chain. To enhance robustness against blur and noise in real-world scenarios, an auxiliary loss with a progressive soft target is employed to better identify what is effective for reconstruction in the high-frequency domain. Minimizing the mutual information while preserving task-relevant features can help remove information that reflects spurious correlations between specific degradations and reconstructed targets. Experiments conducted on real-world image super-resolution datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of recent lightweight SR models without adding any extra inference complexity, and it outperforms existing self-distillation approaches.

  abstract={Generative image modeling enables a wide range of applications but raises ethical concerns about responsible deployment. We introduce an active content tracing method combining image watermarking and Latent Diffusion Models. The goal is for all generated images to conceal an invisible watermark allowing for future detection and/or identification. The method quickly fine-tunes the latent decoder of the image generator, conditioned on a binary signature. A pre-trained watermark extractor recovers the hidden signature from any generated image and a statistical test then determines whether it comes from the generative model. We evaluate the invisibility and robustness of the watermarks on a variety of generation tasks, showing that the Stable Signature is robust to image modifications. For instance, it detects the origin of an image generated from a text prompt, then cropped to keep 10% of the content, with 90+% accuracy at a false positive rate below 10−6.},

  abstract={Static analysis tools have demonstrated effectiveness at finding bugs in real world code. Such tools are increasingly widely adopted to improve software quality in practice. Automated Program Repair (APR) has the potential to further cut down on the cost of improving software quality. However, there is a disconnect between these effective bug-finding tools and APR. Recent advances in APR rely on test cases, making them inapplicable to newly discovered bugs or bugs difficult to test for deterministically (like memory leaks). Additionally, the quality of patches generated to satisfy a test suite is a key challenge. We address these challenges by adapting advances in practical static analysis and verification techniques to enable a new technique that finds and then accurately fixes real bugs without test cases. We present a new automated program repair technique using Separation Logic. At a high-level, our technique reasons over semantic effects of existing program fragments to fix faults related to general pointer safety properties: resource leaks, memory leaks, and null dereferences. The procedure automatically translates identified fragments into source-level patches, and verifies patch correctness with respect to reported faults. In this work we conduct the largest study of automatically fixing undiscovered bugs in real-world code to date. We demonstrate our approach by correctly fixing 55 bugs, including 11 previously undiscovered bugs, in 11 real-world projects.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Noisy label learning (NLL) in open-world scenarios poses a novel challenge due to the presence of noisy data from both known and unknown classes. Most existing methods operate under the closed-set assumption, rendering them vulnerable to open-set noise, which significantly degrades their performance. While some approaches attempt to mitigate the impact of open-set examples, they struggle to learn effective discriminative representations for them, leading to unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, we propose a unified Open Adapter (OpenAda) that identifies open-set noise from both data-centric and learning-based perspectives, and can be easily integrated into mainstream NLL methods to improve their performance and robustness. Specifically, the data-centric part leverages label clusterability to sequentially identify basic clean and basic open-set examples both with high neighbor agreement. The learning-based part integrates one-vs-all classifiers with a progressive open disambiguation strategy to learn a reliable “inlier vs. outlier” boundary for each class. This enables the model to detect challenging open-set examples that partially overlap in the representation space with closed-set ones. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the superiority of our approach. Notably, with minor modifications, DivideMix with OpenAda achieves performance improvements of 9.31% and 18.26% on the open-world CIFAR-80 dataset under 80% symmetric noise and 40% asymmetric noise. The code is available at https://github.com/chenchenzong/OpenAda.},

  title={Distilling Multi-level Semantic Cues across Multi-modalities for Face Forgery Detection}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-1},
  abstract={Existing face forgery detection methods attempt to identify low-level forgery artifacts (e.g., blending boundary, flickering) in spatial-temporal domains or high-level semantic inconsistencies (e.g., abnormal lip movements) between visual-auditory modalities for generalized face forgery detection. However, they still suffer from significant performance degradation when dealing with out-of-domain artifacts, as they only consider single semantic mode inconsistencies, but ignore the complementarity of forgery traces at different levels and different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-modal Multi-level Semantic Cues Distillation Detection framework that adopts the teacher-student protocol to focus on both spatial-temporal artifacts and visual-auditory incoherence to capture multi-level semantic cues. Specifically, our framework primarily comprises the Spatial-Temporal Pattern Learning module and the Visual-Auditory Consistency Modeling module. The Spatial-Temporal Pattern Learning module employs a mask-reconstruction strategy, in which the student network learns diverse spatial-temporal patterns from a pixel-wise teacher network to capture low-level forgery artifacts. The Visual-Auditory Consistency Modeling module is designed to enhance the student network’s ability to identify high-level semantic irregularities, with a visual-auditory consistency modeling expert serving as a guide. Furthermore, a novel Real-Similarity loss is proposed to enhance the proximity of real faces in feature space without explicitly penalizing the distance from manipulated faces, which prevents the overfitting in particular manipulation methods and improves the generalization capability. Extensive experiments show that our method substantially improves the generalization and robustness performance. Particularly, our approach outperforms the SOTA detector by 1.4% in generalization performance on DFDC with large domain gaps, and by 2.0% in the robustness evaluation on the FF++ dataset under various extreme settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/TianXie834/M2SD.},

  pages={},
  abstract={Mining user interests from user behavioral data is critical for many applications. Based on user interests, service providers like advertisers can significantly reduce service delivery costs by offering the most relevant products to their customers. The challenge of accurately and efficiently identifying user interests has been the subject of increasing attention for several years. With the emergence and growing popularity of social media, many users are extensively engaged in social media applications to express their feelings and views about a wide variety of social events/topics as they happen in real time. The abundance of user generated content on social media provides the opportunity to build models that are able to accurately and effectively extract, mine, and predict users’ interests with the hopes of enabling more effective user engagement, better quality delivery of appropriate services, and higher user satisfaction. While traditional methods for building user profiles relied on AI-based preference elicitation techniques that could have been considered intrusive and undesirable by the users, more recent advances are focused on a non-intrusive yet accurate way of determining users’ interests and preferences. In this monograph, the authors cover five important subjects related to the mining of user interests from social media: (1) the foundations of social user interest modeling, (2) techniques that have been adopted or proposed for mining user interests, (3) different evaluation methodologies and benchmark datasets, (4) different applications that have been taking advantage of user interest mining from social media platforms, and (5) existing challenges, open research questions, and opportunities for further work. The monograph is a valuable resource for those who have familiarity with social media mining and the basics of information retrieval (IR) techniques.},

  abstract={Search engines play a crucial role in organizing and delivering information to billions of users worldwide. However, these systems often reflect and amplify existing societal biases and stereotypes through their search results and rankings. This concern has prompted researchers to investigate methods for measuring and reducing algorithmic bias, with the goal of developing more equitable search systems. This monograph presents a comprehensive taxonomy of fairness in search systems and surveys the current research landscape.

  abstract={Since Facebook was renamed Meta, a lot of attention, debate, and exploration have intensified about what the Metaverse is, how it works, and the possible ways to exploit it. It is anticipated that Metaverse will be a continuum of rapidly emerging technologies, usecases, capabilities, and experiences that will make it up for the next evolution of the Internet. Several researchers have already surveyed the literature on artificial intelligence (AI) and wireless communications in realizing the Metaverse. However, due to the rapid emergence and continuous evolution of technologies, there is a need for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of the role of AI, 6G, and the nexus of both in realizing the immersive experiences of Metaverse. Therefore, in this survey, we first introduce the background and ongoing progress in augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR) and spatial computing, followed by the technical aspects of AI and 6G. Then, we survey the role of AI in the Metaverse by reviewing the state-of-the-art in deep learning, computer vision, and Edge AI to extract the requirements of 6G in Metaverse. Next, we investigate the promising services of B5G/6G towards Metaverse, followed by identifying the role of AI in 6G networks and 6G networks for AI in support of Metaverse applications, and the need for sustainability in Metaverse. Finally, we enlist the existing and potential applications, usecases, and projects to highlight the importance of progress in the Metaverse. Moreover, in order to provide potential research directions to researchers, we underline the challenges, research gaps, and lessons learned identified from the literature review of the aforementioned technologies.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={},
  abstract={This monograph is motivated by a number of recent developments that appear to define a possible new role for researchers with an engineering profile. First, there are now several software libraries – such as IBM’s Qiskit, Google’s Cirq, and Xanadu’s PennyLane – that make programming quantum algorithms more accessible, while also providing cloud-based access to actual quantum computers. Second, a new framework is emerging for programming quantum algorithms to be run on current quantum hardware: quantum machine learning. In the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum machine learning is emerging as a dominant paradigm to program gate-based quantum computers. In quantum machine learning, the gates of a quantum circuit are parametrized, and the parameters are tuned via classical optimization based on data and on measurements of the outputs of the circuit. Parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) can efficiently address combinatorial optimization problems, implement probabilistic generative models, and carry out inference (classification and regression). This monograph provides a self-contained introduction to quantum machine learning for an audience of engineers with a background in probability and linear algebra. It first describes the background, concepts, and tools necessary to describe quantum operations and measurements. Then, it covers parametrized quantum circuits, the variational quantum eigensolver, as well as unsupervised and supervised quantum machine learning formulations.},

  abstract={In this monograph, an overview of recent developments and the state-of-the-art in image/video restoration and super-resolution (SR) using deep learning is presented. Deep learning has made a significant impact, not only on computer vision and natural language processing but also on classical signal processing problems such as image/video restoration/SR and compression. Recent advances in neural architectures led to significant improvements in the performance of learned image/video restoration and SR. An important benefit of data-driven deep learning approaches is that neural models can be optimized for any differentiable loss function, including visual perceptual loss functions, leading to perceptual video restoration and SR, which cannot be easily handled by traditional model-based approaches. The publication starts with a problem statement and a short discussion on traditional vs. data-driven solutions. Thereafter, recent advances in neural architectures are considered, and the loss functions and evaluation criteria for image/video restoration and SR are discussed. Also considered are the learned image restoration and SR, as learning either a mapping from the space of degraded images to ideal images based on the universal approximation theorem, or a generative model that captures the probability distribution of ideal images. Practical problems in applying supervised training to real-life restoration and SR are also included, as well as the solution models. In the section on learned video SR, approaches to exploit temporal correlations in learned video processing are covered, and then the perceptual optimization of the network parameters to obtain natural texture and motion is discussed. A comparative discussion of various approaches concludes the publication.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Energy-Based Models (EBMs) are an important class of probabilistic models, also known as random fields and undirected graphical models. EBMs are un-normalized and thus radically different from other popular self-normalized probabilistic models such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), autoregressive models, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs). Over the past years, EBMs have attracted increasing interest not only from the core machine learning community, but also from application domains such as speech, vision, natural language processing (NLP) and so on, due to significant theoretical and algorithmic progress. The sequential nature of speech and language also presents special challenges and needs a different treatment from processing fix-dimensional data (e.g., images). Therefore, the purpose of this monograph is to present a systematic introduction to energy-based models, including both algorithmic progress and applications in speech and language processing. First, the basics of EBMs are introduced, including classic models, recent models parameterized by neural networks, sampling methods, and various learning methods from the classic learning algorithms to the most advanced ones. Then, the application of EBMs in three different scenarios is presented, i.e., for modeling marginal, conditional and joint distributions, respectively. 1) EBMs for sequential data with applications in language modeling, where the main focus is on the marginal distribution of a sequence itself; 2) EBMs for modeling conditional distributions of target sequences given observation sequences, with applications in speech recognition, sequence labeling and text generation; 3) EBMs for modeling joint distributions of both sequences of observations and targets, and their applications in semi-supervised learning and calibrated natural language understanding. Lastly, several open-source toolkits are introduced to help readers get familiar with the techniques for developing and applying energy-based models.},

  abstract={Following the recent progress in the development of Terahertz (THz) generation and detection, THz technology is being widely used to characterize test sample properties in various applications including nondestructive testing, security inspection and medical applications. In this paper, we have presented a broad review of the recent usage of artificial intelligence (AI) particularly, deep learning techniques in various THz sensing, imaging, and spectroscopic applications with emphasis on their implementation for medical imaging of cancerous cells. Initially, the fundamentals principles and techniques for THz generation and detection, imaging and spectroscopy are introduced. Subsequently, a brief overview of AI – machine learning and deep learning techniques is summarized, and their performance is compared. Further, the usage of deep learning algorithms in various THz applications is reported, with focus on metamaterials design and classification, detection, reconstruction, segmentation, parameter extraction and denoising tasks. Moreover, we also report the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models and finally, the existing research challenges in the application of deep learning in THz cancer imaging applications are identified and possible solutions are suggested through emerging trends. With the continuous increase of acquired THz data – sensing, spectral and imaging, artificial intelligence has emerged as a dominant paradigm for embedded data extraction, understanding, perception, decision making and analysis. Towards this end, the integration of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as deep learning with THz applications enable detailed computational and theoretical analysis for better validation and verification than modelling techniques that precede the era of machine learning. The study will facilitate the large-scale clinical applications of deep learning enabled THz imaging systems for the development of smart and connected next generation healthcare systems as well as provide a roadmap for future research direction.},

  year={2025},
  volume={12},
  number={6},
  pages={6371-6395},
  abstract={Due to the ever increasing interdependency across a variety of diverse software and hardware components in information and communications technology (ICT) provisioning, supply chain vulnerabilities (SCVs) targeting such dependencies have evolved as a primary choice for malicious actors to stealthy and complex cyber-attacks. The current modus operandi in the cyber threat spectrum is solely correlated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) that have shown to be prevalent across diversified attacks underpinning cyberwarfare and cybercrime. Hence, defense against such threats is undoubtedly considered as a high priority on a global scale. Nonetheless, the reliance on third-party supply chain software and device across diverse ICT ecosystems, combined with the current defense mechanisms’ inability to identify specific compromised entry points, results in an increased risk of APTs. This survey explores the state-of-the-art to stratify and showcase the properties of supply chain-based APTs, elaborate on reported risks from such APTs, and expand on existing defense methods. This study connects academic research with industry practices to highlight a new and growing problem. It examines supply chain compromises, offers unique insight into how these exploitations occur, and equips cybersecurity practitioners with the knowledge required to design next-generation APT defense mechanisms.},

  abstract={As you look at the title of this chapter, you might wonder why I waited until now—halfway through the book—to offer a coherent theory of soma design. The answer is quite simple: Because soma design is based so heavily on experiences and somatic feelings, I felt it was necessary to give you, the reader, a sense of what such designs actually feel like—how they work, what makes them unique, and how they came about. Articulating a theory of design in words requires a certain distanced, intellectual approach, and yet I am arguing for designs that recognize the soma as the unity of mind and body, intellect and experience. I hope that by now, you have an intuitive sense of what soma designs might look and feel like, which will make my discussion here of soma design theory more meaningful.},

  volume={10},
  number={},
  pages={134018-134028},
  abstract={Deepfake content is created or altered synthetically using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to appear real. It can include synthesizing audio, video, images, and text. Deepfakes may now produce natural-looking content, making them harder to identify. Much progress has been achieved in identifying video deepfakes in recent years; nevertheless, most investigations in detecting audio deepfakes have employed the ASVSpoof or AVSpoof dataset and various machine learning, deep learning, and deep learning algorithms. This research uses machine and deep learning-based approaches to identify deepfake audio. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) technique is used to acquire the most useful information from the audio. We choose the Fake-or-Real dataset, which is the most recent benchmark dataset. The dataset was created with a text-to-speech model and is divided into four sub-datasets: for-rece, for-2-sec, for-norm and for-original. These datasets are classified into sub-datasets mentioned above according to audio length and bit rate. The experimental results show that the support vector machine (SVM) outperformed the other machine learning (ML) models in terms of accuracy on for-rece and for-2-sec datasets, while the gradient boosting model performed very well using for-norm dataset. The VGG-16 model produced highly encouraging results when applied to the for-original dataset. The VGG-16 model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the most recent studies on the implications of keystroke dynamics (KD) patterns in user authentication, identification, and the determination of useful information. Another aim is to provide an extensive and up-to-date survey of the recent literature and potential research directions to understand the present state-of-the-art methodologies in this particular domain that are expected to be beneficial for the KD research community. From January 1st, 2017 to March 13th, 2022, the popular six electronic databases have been searched using a search criterion (“keystroke dynamics” OR “typing pattern”) AND (“authentication” OR “verification” OR “identification”). With this criterion, a total of nine thousand three hundred forty-eight results, including duplicates, were produced. However, one thousand five hundred forty-seven articles have been chosen after removing duplicates and preliminary screening. Due to insufficient information, only one hundred twenty-seven high-quality quantitative research articles have been included in the article selection process. We compared and summarised several factors with multiple tables to comprehend the various methodologies, experimental settings, and findings. In this study, we have identified six unique KD-based designs and presented the status of findings toward an effective solution in authentication, identification, and prediction. We have also discovered considerable heterogeneity across studies in each KD-based design for desktops and smartphones separately. Finally, this paper found a few open research challenges and provided some indications for a deeper understanding of the issues and further study.},

  volume={71},
  number={},
  pages={15005-15024},
  abstract={This study analyzes the current state of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for addressing and mitigating climate change in the manufacturing sector and provides an outlook on future developments. The research is grounded in the concept of general-purpose technologies, motivated by a still limited understanding of innovation patterns for this application context. To this end, we focus on global patenting activity between 2011 and 2023 (5919 granted patents classified for “mitigation or adaptation against climate change” in the “production or processing of goods”). We examined time trends, applicant characteristics, and underlying technologies. A topic modeling analysis was performed to identify emerging themes from the unstructured textual data of the patent abstracts. This allowed the identification of six AI application domains. For each of them, we built a network analysis and ran growth trends and forecasting models. Our results show that patenting activities are mostly oriented toward improving the efficiency and reliability of manufacturing processes in five out of six identified domains (“predictive analytics,” “material sorting,” “defect detection,” “advanced robotics,” and “scheduling”). Instead, AI within the “resource optimization” domain relates to energy management, showing an interplay with other climate-related technologies. Our results also highlight interdependent innovations peculiar to each domain around core AI technologies. Forecasts show that the more specific technologies are within domains, the longer it will take for them to mature. From a practical standpoint, the study sheds light on the role of AI within the broader cleantech innovation landscape and urges policymakers to consider synergies. Managers can find information to define technology portfolios and alliances considering technological coevolution.},

  abstract={Metaverse is an evolving orchestrator of the next-generation Internet architecture that produces an immersive and self-adapting virtual world in which humans perform activities similar to those in the real world, such as playing sports, doing work, and socializing. It is becoming a reality and is driven by ever-evolving advanced technologies such as extended reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain. In this context, Metaverse will play an essential role in developing smart cities, which becomes more evident in the post-COVID-19-pandemic metropolitan setting. However, the new paradigm imposes new challenges, such as developing novel privacy and security threats that can emerge in the digital Metaverse ecosystem. Moreover, it requires the convergence of several media types with the capability to quickly process massive amounts of data to keep the residents safe and well-informed, which can raise issues related to scalability and interoperability. In light of this, this research study aims to review the literature on the state of the art of integrating the Metaverse architecture concepts in smart cities. First, this paper presents the theoretical architecture of Metaverse and discusses international companies’ interest in this emerging technology. It also examines the notion of Metaverse relevant to virtual reality, identifies the prevalent threats, and determines the importance of communication infrastructure in information gathering for efficient Metaverse operation. Next, the notion of blockchain technologies is discussed regarding privacy preservation and how it can provide tamper-proof content sharing among Metaverse users. Finally, the application of distributed Metaverse for social good is highlighted. Most importantly, the paper explores the reflections of this cutting-edge technology on the smart city, talks about the role and impact of the Metaverse in the production of urban policies, and eventually identifies the research gaps and the future research directions in this domain.},

  abstract={Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a significant advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enabling collaborative model training across distributed devices while maintaining data privacy. As the importance of FL and its application in various areas increased, addressing trustworthiness issues in its various aspects became crucial. In this survey, we provided a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art research on Trustworthy FL, exploring existing solutions and key foundations relevant to Trustworthiness in FL. There has been significant growth in the literature on trustworthy centralized Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). However, there is still a need for more focused efforts toward identifying trustworthiness pillars and evaluation metrics in FL. In this paper, we proposed a taxonomy encompassing five main classifications for Trustworthy FL, including Interpretability and Explainability, Transparency, Privacy and Robustness, Fairness, and Accountability. Each category represents a dimension of trust and is further broken down into different sub-categories. Moreover, we addressed trustworthiness in a Decentralized FL (DFL) setting. Communication efficiency is essential for ensuring Trustworthy FL. This paper also highlights the significance of communication efficiency within various Trustworthy FL pillars and investigates existing research on communication-efficient techniques across these pillars. Our survey comprehensively addresses trustworthiness challenges across all aspects within the Trustworthy FL settings. We also proposed a comprehensive architecture for Trustworthy FL, detailing the fundamental principles underlying the concept, and provided an in-depth analysis of trust assessment mechanisms. In conclusion, we identified key research challenges related to every aspect of Trustworthy FL and suggested future research directions. This comprehensive survey served as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on the development and implementation of Trustworthy FL systems, contributing to a more secure and reliable AI landscape.},

  abstract={Understanding the landscape of privacy protection in governmental systems is crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of public services and safeguarding citizens’ sensitive data from breaches or misuse. Systematic mapping and synthesis of previous research can help identify existing privacy-preserving techniques, assess their effectiveness, and highlight areas for improvement, offering valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners. We aim to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of privacy-preserving tools and technologies, focusing on their adoption and governments’ challenges. This study also uncovers emerging trends and future research directions, contributing to developing more robust privacy strategies tailored to government needs.Given its extensive reach and government-centric methodology, this evaluation distinguishes itself from previous research. Our work methodically synthesizes privacy-preserving tools and technologies from the distinct perspective of government roles, in contrast to previous assessments that concentrate narrowly on certain technologies or areas. Our findings offer a synthesis of the government’s diverse roles in privacy preservation—regulator, enforcer, user, and service provider—and address existing concerns and key privacy-related technologies. Finally, we identify significant research opportunities, such as improving privacy-preserving mechanisms to strengthen the integrity of public services and mitigate the risks of data breaches and misuse.},

  abstract={Recent statistics and studies show that the loss generated by insider threats is much higher than that generated by external attacks. More and more organizations are investing in or purchasing insider threat detection systems to prevent insider risks. However, the accurate and timely detection of insider threats faces significant challenges. In this study, we proposed an intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twins and self-attentions based deep learning models. First, this paper introduces insider threats and the challenges in detecting them. Then this paper presents recent related works on solving insider threat detection problems and their limitations. Next, we propose our solutions to address these challenges: building an innovative intelligent insider threat detection framework based on Digital Twin (DT) and self-attention based deep learning models, performing insight analysis of users’ behavior and entities, adopting contextual word embedding techniques using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and sentence embedding technique using Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) model to perform data augmentation to overcome significant data imbalance, and adopting temporal semantic representation of users’ behaviors to build user behavior time sequences. Subsequently, this study built self-attention-based deep learning models to quickly detect insider threats. This study proposes a simplified transformer model named DistilledTrans and applies the original transformer model, DistilledTrans, BERT + final layer, Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa) + final layer, and a hybrid method combining pre-trained (BERT, RoBERTa) with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network model to detect insider threats. Finally, this paper presents experimental results on a dense dataset CERT r4.2 and augmented sporadic dataset CERT r6.2, evaluates their performance, and performs a comparison analysis with state-of-the-art models. Promising experimental results show that 1) contextual word embedding insert and substitution predicted by the BERT model, and context embedding sentences predicted by the GPT-2 model are effective data augmentation approaches to address high data imbalance; 2) DistilledTrans trained with sporadic dataset CERT r6.2 augmented by the contextual embedding sentence method predicted by GPT-2, outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of all evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). Additionally, its structure is much simpler, and thus training time and computing cost are much less than those of recent models; 3) when trained with the dense dataset CERT r4.2, pre-trained models BERT plus a final layer or RoBERTa plus a final layer can achieve significantly higher performance than the current models with a very little sacrifice of precision. However, complex hybrid methods may not be required.},

  year={2019},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={The goal of Optimal Transport (OT) is to define geometric tools that are useful to compare probability distributions. Their use dates back to 1781. Recent years have witnessed a new revolution in the spread of OT, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This monograph reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these applications. Computational Optimal Transport presents an overview of the main theoretical insights that support the practical effectiveness of OT before explaining how to turn these insights into fast computational schemes. Written for readers at all levels, the authors provide descriptions of foundational theory at two-levels. Generally accessible to all readers, more advanced readers can read the specially identified more general mathematical expositions of optimal transport tailored for discrete measures. Furthermore, several chapters deal with the interplay between continuous and discrete measures, and are thus targeting a more mathematically-inclined audience. This monograph will be a valuable reference for researchers and students wishing to get a thorough understanding of Computational Optimal Transport, a mathematical gem at the interface of probability, analysis and optimization.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Gender bias is a pervasive issue that continues to influence various aspects of society, including the outcomes of information retrieval (IR) systems. As these systems become increasingly integral to accessing and navigating the vast amounts of information available today, the need to understand and mitigate gender bias within them is paramount. This monograph provides a comprehensive examination of the origins, manifestations, and consequences of gender bias in IR systems, as well as the current methodologies employed to address these biases. Theoretical frameworks surrounding gender and its representation in artificial intelligence (AI) systems are explored, particularly focusing on how traditional gender binaries are perpetuated and reinforced through data and algorithmic processes. Metrics and methodologies used to identify and measure gender bias within IR systems are then analyzed, offering a detailed evaluation of existing approaches and their limitations. Subsequent sections address the sources of gender bias, including biased input queries, retrieval methods, and gold standard datasets. Various data-driven and method-level debiasing strategies are presented, including techniques for debiasing neural embeddings and algorithmic approaches aimed at reducing bias in IR system outputs. The monograph concludes with a discussion of the challenges and limitations faced by current debiasing efforts and provides insights into future research directions that could lead to more equitable and inclusive IR systems. This monograph serves as a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students in the fields of information retrieval, artificial intelligence, and data science, providing the knowledge and tools needed to address gender bias and contribute to the development of fair and unbiased information systems.},

  abstract={Information retrieval researchers develop algorithmic solutions to hard problems and insist on a proper, multifaceted evaluation of ideas. As we move towards even more complex deep learning models in a wide range of applications, questions on efficiency once again resurface with renewed urgency. Efficiency is no longer limited to time and space but has found new, challenging dimensions that stretch to resource-, sample- and energy-efficiency with ramifications for researchers, users, and the environment. This monograph takes a step towards promoting the study of efficiency in the era of neural information retrieval by offering a comprehensive survey of the literature on efficiency and effectiveness in ranking and retrieval. It is inspired by the parallels that exist between the challenges in neural network-based ranking solutions and their predecessors, decision forest-based learning-to-rank models, and the connections between the solutions the literature to date has to offer. By understanding the fundamentals underpinning these algorithmic and data structure solutions one can better identify future directions and more efficiently determine the merits of ideas.},

  abstract={Recommendation, information retrieval, and other information access systems pose unique challenges for investigating and applying the fairness and non-discrimination concepts that have been developed for studying other machine learning systems. While fair information access shares many commonalities with fair classification, there are important differences such as the multistakeholder nature of information access applications, the rank-based problem setting, the centrality of personalization in many cases, and the role of user response. These all complicate the problem of identifying precisely what types and operationalizations of fairness may be relevant. In this monograph, the authors present a taxonomy of the various dimensions of fair information access and survey the literature to date on this new and rapidly-growing topic. They preface this with brief introductions to information access and algorithmic fairness to facilitate the use of this work by scholars who wish to study their intersection. The authors conclude with several open problems in fair information access and present suggestions for how to approach research in this space.},

  booktitle={Data Analytics on Graphs Part III: Machine Learning on Graphs, from Graph Topology to Applications},
  year={2020},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={},
  abstract={Modern data analytics applications on graphs often operate on domains where graph topology is not known a priori, and hence its determination becomes part of the problem definition, rather than serving as prior knowledge which aids the problem solution. Part III of this monograph starts by a comprehensive account of ways to learn the pertinent graph topology, ranging from the simplest case where the physics of the problem already suggest a possible graph structure, through to general cases where the graph structure is to be learned from the data observed on a graph. A particular emphasis is placed on the use of standard “relationship measures” in this context, including the correlation and precision matrices, together with the ways to combine these with the available prior knowledge and structural conditions, such as the smoothness of the graph signals or sparsity of graph connections. Next, for learning sparse graphs (that is, graphs with a small number of edges), the utility of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, known as LASSO is addressed, along with its graph specific variant, the graphical LASSO. For completeness, both variants of LASSO are derived in an intuitive way, starting from basic principles. An in-depth elaboration of the graph topology learning paradigm is provided through examples on physically well defined graphs, such as electric circuits, linear heat transfer, social and computer networks, and springmass systems. We also review main trends in graph neural networks (GNN) and graph convolutional networks (GCN) from the perspective of graph signal filtering. Particular insight is given to the role of diffusion processes over graphs, to show that GCNs can be understood from the graph diffusion perspective. Given the largely heuristic nature of the existing GCNs, their treatment through graph diffusion processes may also serve as a basis for new designs of GCNs. Tensor representation of lattice-structured graphs is next considered, and it is shown that tensors (multidimensional data arrays) can be treated a special class of graph signals, whereby the graph vertices reside on a high-dimensional regular lattice structure. The concept of graph tensor networks then provides a unifying framework for learning on irregular domains. This part of monograph concludes with an in-dept account of emerging applications in financial data processing and underground transportation network modeling. By means of portfolio cuts of an asset graph, we show how domain knowledge can be meaningfully incorporated into investment analysis. In the underground transportation example, we demonstrate how graph theory can be used to identify those stations in the London underground network which have the greatest influence on the functionality of the traffic, and proceed, in an innovative way, to assess the impact of a station closure on service levels across the city.},

Automated deep learning (AutoDL) endeavors to minimize the need for human involvement and is best known for its achievements in neural architecture search (NAS). In this monograph, the authors examine research efforts into automation across the entirety of an archetypal DL workflow. In so doing, they propose a comprehensive set of ten criteria by which to assess existing work in both individual publications and broader research areas, namely novelty, solution quality, efficiency, stability, interpretability, reproducibility, engineering quality, scalability, generalizability, and eco-friendliness. Aimed at students and researchers, this monograph provides an evaluative overview of AutoDL in the early 2020s, identifying where future opportunities for progress may exist.},

  abstract={The aim of this survey is to bridge two important components of modern information access: information retrieval (IR) and knowledge graphs (KGs). Modern IR systems can benefit from information available in KGs in multiple ways, independent of whether the KGs are publicly available or proprietary ones. The authors provide an overview of the literature on KGs in the context of IR and the components required when building IR systems that leverage KGs. As an understanding of the intersection of IR and KGs is beneficial to many researchers and practitioners, they consider prior work from two complementary angles: leveraging KGs for information retrieval and enriching KGs using IR techniques. They summarize research work, group related approaches, and discuss challenges shared across tasks at the interface of IR and KGs. In Knowledge Graphs: An Information Retrieval Perspective, the authors present an extensive overview of tasks related to KGs from an IR perspective, provide a thorough review for each task, and present discussions on common issues that are shared among the tasks. They discuss common issues that appear across the tasks that consider and identify future directions for addressing them.

The TDD workflow future-proofs apps so that they can be modified without fear of breaking existing functionality. Another benefit of TDD is that it helps software development teams communicate their intentions more clearly, by way of test specifications. This book teaches you how to apply TDD when building React apps. You’ll create a sample app using the same React libraries and tools that professional React developers use, such as Jest, React Router, Redux, Relay (GraphQL), Cucumber, and Puppeteer. The TDD workflow is supported by various testing techniques and patterns, which are useful even if you’re not following the TDD process. This book covers these techniques by walking you through the creation of a component test framework.

  abstract={Identifying the brain responses of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOCs), which include comas, vegetative states (VSs, also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS)) and minimally conscious states (MCSs), based on electroencephalography (EEG) has important clinical diagnosis implications. However, due to impaired motor and cognitive abilities, patients with DOCs may not be able to express their feelings and their brain responses to different stimuli, making it difficult to correctly label data. EEG classification algorithms trained with these data cannot make reliable classifications and predictions for clinical diagnosis purposes. To identify the brain responses produced for different types of stimuli in patients with DOCs, we proposed a self-supervised contrastive domain generalization framework (SSCDG) for cross-subject EEG classification. The model was first trained with healthy-subject EEG data induced by different stimuli to learn their corresponding unsupervised representations. Then, we used these representations to train a classifier to predict the emotional states of patients with DOCs under the corresponding stimuli. SSCDG was first evaluated on the SEED dataset, and it achieved an accuracy of 87.6%, which was 1.1% higher than that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Moreover, the SSCDG method was utilized to categorize EEG data acquired from seventeen DOC patients, including eleven in a UWS state and six in an MCS state, with seven patients demonstrating notable accuracy in three-class EEG classification tasks. The SSCDG results indicated that the seven patients with DOCs may have shown classifiable EEG responses to the presented stimuli.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={This paper explores the dual role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of online misinformation and disinformation. In today’s digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks. The paper concludes by acknowledging LLMs as powerful tools with significant implications in both spreading and combating misinformation in the digital age.},

  pages={316-326},
  abstract={We present an analysis of the representation of gender as a data dimension in data visualizations and propose a set of considerations around visual variables and annotations for gender-related data. Gender is a common demographic dimension of data collected from study or survey participants, passengers, or customers, as well as across academic studies, especially in certain disciplines like sociology. Our work contributes to multiple ongoing discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing specific data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may, inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from five different scientific communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase. Overall we found that representation types are community-specific, color hue is the dominant visual channel for gender data, and nonconforming gender is under-represented. We end our paper with a discussion of considerations for gender visualization derived from our coding and the literature and recommendations for large data collection bodies.

  abstract={We present the first systematic study on concealed object detection (COD), which aims to identify objects that are visually embedded in their background. The high intrinsic similarities between the concealed objects and their background make COD far more challenging than traditional object detection/segmentation. To better understand this task, we collect a large-scale dataset, called COD10K, which consists of 10,000 images covering concealed objects in diverse real-world scenarios from 78 object categories. Further, we provide rich annotations including object categories, object boundaries, challenging attributes, object-level labels, and instance-level annotations. Our COD10K is the largest COD dataset to date, with the richest annotations, which enables comprehensive concealed object understanding and can even be used to help progress several other vision tasks, such as detection, segmentation, classification etc. Motivated by how animals hunt in the wild, we also design a simple but strong baseline for COD, termed the Search Identification Network (SINet). Without any bells and whistles, SINet outperforms twelve cutting-edge baselines on all datasets tested, making them robust, general architectures that could serve as catalysts for future research in COD. Finally, we provide some interesting findings, and highlight several potential applications and future directions.

  abstract={Affective computing has an unprecedented potential to change the way humans interact with technology. While the last decades have witnessed vast progress in the field, multimodal affective computing systems are generally black box by design. As affective systems start to be deployed in real-world scenarios, such as education or healthcare, a shift of focus toward improved transparency and interpretability is needed. In this context, how do we explain the output of affective computing models? and how to do so without limiting predictive performance? In this article, we review affective computing work from an explainable AI (XAI) perspective, collecting and synthesizing relevant papers into three major XAI approaches: premodel (applied before training), in-model (applied during training), and postmodel (applied after training). We present and discuss the most fundamental challenges in the field, namely, how to relate explanations back to multimodal and time-dependent data, how to integrate context and inductive biases into explanations using mechanisms such as attention, generative modeling, or graph-based methods, and how to capture intramodal and cross-modal interactions in post hoc explanations. While explainable affective computing is still nascent, existing methods are promising, contributing not only toward improved transparency but, in many cases, surpassing state-of-the-art results. Based on these findings, we explore directions for future research and discuss the importance of data-driven XAI and explanation goals, and explainee needs definition, as well as causability or the extent to which a given method leads to human understanding.},
