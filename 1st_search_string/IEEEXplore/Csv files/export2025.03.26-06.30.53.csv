However, according to the multi-illumination imaging equation, the color of each pixel is determined by various components, including the innate color of the scene content, the colors of multiple illuminations, and the weightings of these illuminations. Failing to distinguish between these components results in color coupling. On the one hand, there is color coupling between illumination and scene content, where estimations are easily misled by the colors of the content, and the distribution of the estimated illuminations is relatively scattered. On the other hand, there is color coupling between illuminations, where estimations are susceptible to interference from high-frequency and heterogeneous illumination colors, and the local contrast is low. To address color coupling, we propose a Color Decoupling Network (CDNet) that includes a Content Color Awareness Module (CCAM) and a Contrast HArmonization Module (CHAM). CCAM learns scene content color priors, decoupling the colors of content and illuminations by providing the model with the color features of the content, thereby reducing out-of-gamut estimations and enhancing consistency. CHAM constrains feature representation, decoupling illuminants by mutual calibration between adjacent features. CHAM utilizes spatial correlation to make the model more sensitive to the relationships between neighboring features and utilizes illumination disparity degree to guide feature classification. By enhancing the uniqueness of homogeneous illumination features and the distinctiveness of heterogeneous illumination features, CHAM improves local edge contrast. Additionally, by allocating fine-grained margin coefficients to emphasize the soft distinctiveness of similar illumination features, further enhancing local contrast. Extensive experiments on single- and multi-illumination benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2024.3523019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10816431","Multi-illumination color constancy;illumination map estimation;color decoupling;feature calibration;semantic","Lighting;Image color analysis;Estimation;Couplings;Feature extraction;Histograms;Hands;Calibration;Visualization;Semantics","","","","","IEEE","26 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This kind of attack can potentially result in severe consequences in the real world. Therefore, research on defending against backdoor attacks has emerged rapidly. In this article, we have provided a comprehensive survey of backdoor attacks, detections, and defenses previously demonstrated on deep learning.

Furthermore, we have analyzed some limitations in existing methods and, based on this, pointed out several promising future research directions.

This monograph develops a comprehensive statistical learning framework that uses Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) under the Wasserstein metric to ensure robustness to perturbations in the data. The authors introduce the reader to the fundamental properties of the Wasserstein metric and the DRO formulation, before explaining the theory in detail and its application. They cover a series of learning problems, including (i) distributionally robust linear regression; (ii) distributionally robust regression with group structure in the predictors; (iii) distributionally robust multi-output regression and multiclass classification; (iv) optimal decision making that combines distributionally robust regression with nearest-neighbor estimation; (v) distributionally robust semi-supervised learning; (vi) distributionally robust reinforcement learning. Throughout the monograph, the authors use applications in medicine and health care to illustrate the theoretical ideas in practice. They include numerical experiments and case studies using synthetic and real data. Distributionally Robust Learning provides a detailed insight into a technique that has gained a lot of recent interest in developing robust supervised learning solutions that are founded in sound mathematical principles.

Sound often provides information about the specific context of a scene and is closely related to a certain part of the scene or object. However, existing image stylization works have focused on stylizing the entire image using an image or text input. Stylizing a particular part of the image based on audio input is natural but challenging. This work proposes a framework in which a user provides an audio input to localize the target in the input image and another to locally stylize the target object or scene. We first produce a fine localization map using an audio-visual localization network leveraging CLIP embedding space. We then utilize an implicit neural representation (INR) along with the predicted localization map to stylize the target based on sound information. The INR manipulates local pixel values to be semantically consistent with the provided audio input. Our experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms other audio-guided stylization methods. Moreover, we observe that our method constructs concise localization maps and naturally manipulates the target object or scene in accordance with the given audio input.","2096-0662","","10.1007/s41095-024-0413-5","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10884998","audio guidance;image style transfer;implicit neural representations (INR)","Location awareness;Image segmentation;Visualization;Semantics;Electronic mail;Engines;Contrastive learning;Water resources;Noise;Space heating","","","","","","13 Feb 2025","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, current Representation Learning (RL) methods struggle to extract meaningful features from such data, leading to reduced accuracy in network intrusion detection (NID). To address this challenge, we propose the Gaussian Mixture Cramer-Wold Auto-Encoder (GMCWAE), designed to learn low-dimensional representations of network traffic that are both interpretable and discriminative, thereby enhancing the detection performance of classifiers. Furthermore, we integrate the lightweight ensemble learning method Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) for detecting intrusive traffic. A comprehensive evaluation of the multiclass classification performance was conducted using three benchmark datasets: NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IoT 2023. Compared to existing supervised dimensionality reduction methods, the low-dimensional representations learned by GMCWAE across the three datasets achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores across all classifiers used. And the proposed NID method achieved accuracies of 83.1%, 81.1%, and 97.62% across the three datasets, showing strong competitiveness compared to recent related works. The results indicate that GMCWAE is capable of providing high-quality low-dimensional representations of network traffic for resource-constrained devices, and the proposed NID model effectively safeguards against network threats in IoT environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3542845","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U24A20241); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10891521","Network intrusion detection;Internet of Things;Dimensionality reduction;Representation Learning","Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Telecommunication traffic;Representation learning;Kernel;Accuracy;Iron;Gaussian distribution;Benchmark testing;Bayes methods","","","","","IEEE","17 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In order to reach the desired professionalism, it requires years of long and exhausting practice, good physical condition, musicality, but also, a good understanding of choreography. Capturing dance motions and transferring them to digital avatars is commonly used in the film and entertainment industries. However, so far, access to high-quality dance data is very limited, mainly due to the many practical difficulties in capturing the movements of dancers, making it prohibitive for large-scale data acquisition. In this paper, we present a model that enhances the professionalism of amateur dance movements, allowing movement quality to be improved in both spatial and temporal domains. Our model consists of a dance-to-music alignment stage responsible for learning the optimal temporal alignment path between dance and music, and a dance-enhancement stage that injects features of professionalism in both spatial and temporal domains. To learn a homogeneous distribution and credible mapping between the heterogeneous professional and amateur datasets, we generate amateur data from professional dances taken from the AIST++ dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by comparing it with two baseline motion transfer methods via thorough qualitative visual controls, quantitative metrics, and a perceptual study.

However, most existing CIS methods are limited in their maximum capacity due to insufficient diversity in their hash sequences. In addition, these methods struggle to maintain high robustness against both geometric and non-geometric attacks simultaneously. To address these two issues, a new coverless image steganography method is proposed to enhance CIS methods' applicability, security, and robustness in highly insecure networks. During the hiding process, hash sequences are generated by a SHA-256 algorithm that integrates inter-block and inter-channel fusion, providing higher diversity than other CIS methods. Consequently, the proposed CIS method achieves higher capacity on publicly available datasets. During the extraction process, an evaluation metric that combines visual and histogram similarity is designed to improve the accuracy of inverse image retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CIS method achieves capacity increases of 26.73% and 38.34% over other CIS methods on the VOC and COCO datasets, respectively. Moreover, this method exhibits nearly 100% robustness against common active steganalysis.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2024.3521424","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10812863","Coverless image steganography;hash generation algorithm;inverse image retrieval;steganalysis","Steganography;Robustness;Feature extraction;Data mining;Image retrieval;Visualization;Accuracy;Software;Indexes;Histograms","","","","","IEEE","23 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this article, we will shed a light on the document image processing pipeline, from scan to information extraction. As it turns out, human perceptual-driven algorithms are among the most powerful approaches for generic document image understanding, required to deal with a myriad of layouts. In this context, we will in particular explain Gestalt visioning and the linked concept of text homogeneity that allows for enhanced layout analysis and even damage recognition, especially relevant in a cultural heritage setting.

The purpose of facial image deblurring is to recover a clear image from a blurry input image, which can improve the recognition accuracy, etc. However, general deblurring methods do not perform well on facial images. Therefore, some face deblurring methods have been proposed to improve performance by adding semantic or structural information as specific priors according to the characteristics of the facial images. In this paper, we survey and summarize recently published methods for facial image deblurring, most of which are based on deep learning. First, we provide a brief introduction to the modeling of image blurring. Next, we summarize face deblurring methods into two categories: model-based methods and deep learning-based methods. Furthermore, we summarize the datasets, loss functions, and performance evaluation metrics commonly used in the neural network training process. We show the performance of classical methods on these datasets and metrics and provide a brief discussion on the differences between model-based and learning-based methods.

Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to recover HR frames from low-resolution (LR) frames. While deep neural network (DNN)-based SR methods have outperformed traditional techniques in quality, they face performance challenges. FPGA-based SR accelerators have been developed to optimize the performance and power efficiency. However, most of these accelerators process only uncompressed video frames and perform per-frame DNN inference, overlooking the temporal-spatial information inherent in compressed video bitstreams. We propose a novel compressed video SR workflow that includes a codec information reuse algorithm and a dedicated FPGA accelerator named Co-ViSu. Our approach leverages the observation that non-key frames can be reconstructed using codec information and HR key-frames, significantly reducing DNN computations. The Co-ViSu algorithm employs sub-pixel interpolation to enhance high-frequency details and an MV-aware method to improve SR reconstruction quality. The Co-ViSu hardware integrates decoder, SR, and encoder engines within a parallel pipeline architecture, utilizing codec information reuse to bypass non-key frame decoding, eliminate complex DNN computations, and accelerate encoding processes. Experimental results demonstrate that Co-ViSu achieves performance improvements ranging from 3.6x to 9.4x and a 4.2x gain in energy efficiency with minimal quality loss compared to traditional flow. Additionally, Co-ViSu offers a 2.1x increase in throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2025.3543428","Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:Y201923); the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB44030100); YUSUR Technology Co., Ltd; National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002340,62090020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10891735","Super-resolution;Codec;Accelerator;FPGA","Binary sequences;Streaming media;Decoding;Artificial neural networks;Superresolution;Kernel;Engines;Design automation;Video codecs;Throughput","","","","","IEEE","18 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous efforts mainly aimed at creating a common embedding space to bridge domain gaps. However, sketches’ subjective and abstract nature, known as confounders, potentially reduces learning performance of matching with 3D shapes. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a sketch causal disentangled learning for SBSR, named SCDL, which introduce causal intervention to explicitly disentangle sketches into the inherent shared semantic part, and other unrelated confounders to classification (styles, abstraction levels, etc.) for the first time. Specifically, we construct a structural causal model (SCM) in the sketch branch under the dual variational autoencoder (VAE) architectures to alleviate confounders negative impact through learning the semantic attributes in the latent variable space. Next, we adopt a learning strategy on the separated semantic latent variables to construct a shared semantic embedding space further to make cross-modal features of the same class more similar, alleviating the cross-modality discrepancies effectively and establishing new state-of-the-art on three benchmarks.

Milford",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Semantics for Robotic Mapping, Perception and Interaction: A Survey","","2020","","","","","For robots to navigate and interact more richly with the world around them, they will likely require a deeper understanding of the world in which they operate. In robotics and related research fields, the study of understanding is often referred to as semantics, which dictates what does the world ‘mean’ to a robot, and is strongly tied to the question of how to represent that meaning. With humans and robots increasingly operating in the same world, the prospects of human-robot interaction also bring semantics and ontology of natural language into the picture. Driven by need, as well as by enablers like increasing availability of training data and computational resources, semantics is a rapidly growing research area in robotics. The field has received significant attention in the research literature to date, but most reviews and surveys have focused on particular aspects of the topic: the technical research issues regarding its use in specific robotic topics like mapping or segmentation, or its relevance to one particular application domain like autonomous driving. A new treatment is therefore required, and is also timely because so much relevant research has occurred since many of the key surveys were published. This survey provides an overarching snapshot of where semantics in robotics stands today. We establish a taxonomy for semantics research in or relevant to robotics, split into four broad categories of activity in which semantics are extracted, used, or both. Within these broad categories, we survey dozens of major topics including fundamentals from the computer vision field and key robotics research areas utilizing semantics such as mapping, navigation and interaction with the world. The survey also covers key practical considerations, including enablers like increased data availability and improved computational hardware, and major application areas where semantics is or is likely to play a key role. In creating this survey, we hope to provide researchers across academia and industry with a comprehensive reference that helps facilitate future research in this exciting field.","","9781680837698","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9307215.pdf&bkn=9307214&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","25 Dec 2020","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

"An Introduction to Deep Survival Analysis Models for Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes","G. H. Chen",NA,An Introduction to Deep Survival Analysis Models for Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes,"","2025","","","","","The earliest research into time-to-event outcomes can be dated back to the 17th century. Here the initial focus was predicting time until death, hence the term survival analysis. Applications of time-to-event outcomes are to be found in many walks of life, such as insurance, medicine, and even calculating when will a customer end their subscription. Recently, the machine learning community has made significant methodological advances in survival analysis that take advantage of the representation learning ability of deep neural networks. At this point, there is a proliferation of deep survival analysis models. In this monograph, the author provides a self-contained modern introduction to survival analysis. The focus is on predicting time-to-event outcomes at the individual data point level with the help of neural networks. They provide the reader with a working understanding of precisely what the basic time-to-event prediction problem is, how it differs from standard regression and classification, and how key “design patterns” have been used time after time to derive new time-to-event prediction models. The author also details two extensions of the basic time-to-event prediction setup, namely the competing risks setting and the dynamic setting. The monograph concludes with a discussion of a variety of topics such as fairness, causal reasoning, interpretability, and statistical guarantees. This timely monograph provides researchers and students with a succinct introduction to the use of time-to-event outcomes in modern artificial intelligence driven systems.","","9781638284550","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10829524.pdf&bkn=10829523&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","6 Jan 2025","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

We have created various computer-mediated virtual environments, including social networks, video conferencing, virtual 3D worlds (e.g., VR Chat), augmented reality applications (e.g., Pokémon Go), and Non-Fungible Token Games (e.g., Upland). Such virtual environments, albeit non-perpetual and unconnected, have brought us various degrees of digital transformation. The term ‘metaverse’ has been coined to facilitate further digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital ‘big bang’ of our cyberspace is not far away. This monograph presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital ‘big bang’. It is essential to highlight that the metaverse encompasses diverse technologies and ecosystems, calling it an interdisciplinary and emerging field. Its primary objective is to provide users with satisfactory and interactive experiences. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. Eight enabling technologies are rigorously examined - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, six user-centric factors are discussed – Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy, Social Acceptability, Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability. Finally, a concrete research agenda is examined for developing the metaverse.","","9781638284451","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10747217.pdf&bkn=10747216&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","8 Nov 2024","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

The task is even harder in the presence of participating background surfaces. The two methods proposed in this paper use sinusoidal patterns, each with a frequency chosen in the frequency range allowed by the projection optics of the projector-camera system. They differ in the way in which the camera-projector correspondence map is established, as well as in the number of patterns and the processing time required. The first method utilizes the discrete Fourier transform, performed on the intensity signal measured at a camera pixel, to inventory projector columns illuminating directly and indirectly the scene point imaged by that pixel. The second method goes beyond discrete Fourier transform and achieves the same goal by fitting a proposed analytical model to the measured intensity signal. Once the one (camera pixel) to many (projector columns) correspondence is established, a surface continuity constraint is applied to extract the one to one correspondence map linked to the semi-transparent surface. This map is used to determine the 3D point cloud of the surface by triangulation. Experimental results demonstrate the performance (accuracy, reliability) achieved by the proposed methods.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2024.3477413","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10722883","3D shape measurement;3D point cloud;semi-transparent surfaces;structured light;fringe projection;curve fitting;parameter estimation;Discrete Fourier Transform","Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Shape;Shape measurement;Surface reconstruction;Surface treatment;Lighting;Discrete Fourier transforms;Phase measurement;Distortion measurement","","","","","Crown","18 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Fischione",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,Machine Learning for Spectrum Sharing: A Survey,"","2024","","","","","The 5th generation (5G) of wireless systems is being deployed with the aim to provide many sets of wireless communication services, such as low data rates for a massive amount of devices, broadband, low latency, and industrial wireless access. Such an aim is even more complex in the next generation wireless systems (6G) where wireless connectivity is expected to serve any connected intelligent unit, such as software robots and humans interacting in the metaverse, autonomous vehicles, drones, trains, or smart sensors monitoring cities, buildings, and the environment. As the wireless devices will be orders of magnitude denser than in 5G cellular systems, and due to the complex quality of service requirements, the access to the wireless spectrum will have to be appropriately shared to avoid congestion, poor quality of service, or unsatisfactory communication delays. Spectrum sharing methods have been the objective of intense study through model-based approaches, such as optimization or game theories. However, these methods may fail when facing the complexity of the communication environments in 5G, 6G, and beyond. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application and development of data-driven methods, namely machine learning methods, to handle the complex operation of spectrum sharing. In this monograph, a complete overview of the state-of-the-art of machine learning for spectrum sharing is provided. First, the authors map the most prominent methods that are encountered in spectrum sharing. Then, it is shown how these machine learning methods are applied to the numerous dimensions and sub-problems of spectrum sharing, such as spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum access, and spectrum handoff. Finally, several open questions and future trends are highlighted.","","9781638284314","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10747219.pdf&bkn=10747218&pdfType=book","Spectrum sharing","","","","","","","8 Nov 2024","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Feldman",NA,Chaos and Dynamical Systems,"","2019","","","","","Chaos and Dynamical Systems presents an accessible, clear introduction to dynamical systems and chaos theory, important and exciting areas that have shaped many scientific fields. While the rules governing dynamical systems are well-specified and simple, the behavior of many dynamical systems is remarkably complex. Of particular note, simple deterministic dynamical systems produce output that appears random and for which long-term prediction is impossible. Using little math beyond basic algebra, David Feldman gives readers a grounded, concrete, and concise overview.In initial chapters, Feldman introduces iterated functions and differential equations. He then surveys the key concepts and results to emerge from dynamical systems: chaos and the butterfly effect, deterministic randomness, bifurcations, universality, phase space, and strange attractors. Throughout, Feldman examines possible scientific implications of these phenomena for the study of complex systems, highlighting the relationships between simplicity and complexity, order and disorder.Filling the gap between popular accounts of dynamical systems and chaos and textbooks aimed at physicists and mathematicians, Chaos and Dynamical Systems will be highly useful not only to students at the undergraduate and advanced levels, but also to researchers in the natural, social, and biological sciences.","","9780691189390","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9453370.pdf&bkn=9453369&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","13 Jul 2021","","","Princeton University Press","Princeton University Press eBooks"

Tondi",NA; NA,Theoretical Foundations of Adversarial Binary Detection,"","2021","","","","","Binary detection is a ubiquitous problem in virtually all branches of science and technology. In many cases, binary detection must be carried out in a setting wherein the presence of an adversary aiming at inducing a wrong decision cannot be ruled out. Applications include network monitoring, spam filtering, multimedia forensics, video surveillance and biometric authentication to name but a few. In these cases, the attack is carried out at the time of testing. With the advent of widespread machine learning tools, the attacker can act during the learning phase, making it harder to detect. The main idea behind adversarial detection theory is to cast the detection problem into a game-theoretic framework. This allows the goals and the actions available to the two contenders to be rigorously defined. In this monograph, the authors address several variants of a general adversarial binary detection problem, depending on the knowledge available to the Defender and the Attacker of the statistical characterization of a system. They lead the reader through the considerations and solutions under two hypotheses, using a framework that can be adopted in many applications.

Often, it is easier for a teacher to demonstrate a desired behavior rather than attempt to manually engineer it. This process of learning from demonstrations, and the study of algorithms to do so, is called imitation learning. An Algorithmic Perspective on Imitation Learning provides the reader with an introduction to imitation learning. It covers the underlying assumptions, approaches, and how they relate; the rich set of algorithms developed to tackle the problem; and advice on effective tools and implementation. An Algorithmic Perspective on Imitation Learning serves two audiences. First, it familiarizes machine learning experts with the challenges of imitation learning, particularly those arising in robotics, and the interesting theoretical and practical distinctions between it and more familiar frameworks like statistical supervised learning theory and reinforcement learning. Second, it provides roboticists and experts in applied artificial intelligence with a broader appreciation for the frameworks and tools available for imitation learning. It pays particular attention to the intimate connection between imitation learning approaches and those of structured prediction.","","9781680834116","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8620669.pdf&bkn=8620668&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","24 Jan 2019","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Gao",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"Vision-Language Pre-Training: Basics, Recent Advances, and Future Trends","","2022","","","","","Humans perceive the world through many channels, such as images viewed by the eyes, or voices heard by the ears. Though any individual channel might be incomplete or noisy, humans can naturally align and fuse information collected from multiple channels in order to grasp the key concepts needed for a better understanding of the world. One of the core aspirations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to develop algorithms that endow computers with an ability to effectively learn from multimodal (or, multi-channel) data. This data is similar to sights and sounds attained from vision and language that help humans make sense of the world around us. For example, computers could mimic this ability by searching the most relevant images to a text query (or vice versa), and by describing the content of an image using natural language. Vision-and-Language (VL), a popular research area that sits at the nexus of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aims to achieve this goal. This monograph surveys vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods for multimodal intelligence that have been developed in the last few years. Approaches are grouped into three categories: (i) VLP for image-text tasks, such as image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual question answering, and visual grounding; (ii) VLP for core computer vision tasks, such as (open-set) image classification, object detection, and segmentation; and (iii) VLP for video-text tasks, such as video captioning, video-text retrieval, and video question answering. For each category, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art methods is presented, and the progress that has been made and challenges still being faced are discussed, using specific systems and models as case studies. In addition, for each category, advanced topics being actively explored in the research community are presented, such as big foundation models, unified modeling, in-context few-shot learning, knowledge, robustness, and computer vision in the wild, to name a few.","","9781638281337","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9972998.pdf&bkn=9972997&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","7 Dec 2022","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

In this paper, we propose a zero-shot image editing method, named Enhance Editability for text-based image Editing via Efficient CLIP guidance (E4C), which presents an innovative adaptive feature sharing mechanism to enable multi-task editing. Additionally, a novel random gateway mechanism is designed to efficiently introduce CLIP guidance into the multi-step sampling of diffusion, achieving high congruence between editing results and target text.

They enhance the capacity and coverage of satellite communication systems using amplifying relays deployed in high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) in the air. Free-space optical (FSO) communication, which offers larger capacity compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) communication, can enhance the capacity of SAGIN to meet the requirements of sixth-generation (6 G) systems. This study assumes a hybrid FSO/RF SAGIN, where high-capacity but atmospherically unstable FSO communications and low-capacity but atmospherically stable RF communications are used in a complementary manner in the satellite-HAPS-ground link. For the SAGIN coverage area to expand, the transmission capacity of the system needs to be further improved. Therefore, efficient use of the limited RF link frequency bandwidth is crucial, and the satellite and HAPS must cooperate to share and meet ground traffic requirements by controlling the areas they each cover. In addition, HAPS placement significantly impacts the spectral efficiency of the system because the positional relationship between the satellite and HAPS affects the transmission capacity. Therefore, this study proposes a combined control method for optimizing HAPS placement and coverage area of the satellite and HAPS. Furthermore, a solution space reduction method is incorporated into the proposed method for efficient exploration of the optimal control parameters. The solution exploration efficiency and data transmission performance using the proposed method are evaluated through simulations.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2025.3546335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10906539","Free-space optical (FSO) communication;high-altitude platform station (HAPS);space–air–ground integrated networks (SAGIN);spectral efficiency;6 G","Satellites;Low earth orbit satellites;Radio frequency;Satellite broadcasting;Atmospheric modeling;Relays;Spectral efficiency;Space-air-ground integrated networks;Downlink;Attenuation","","","","","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To simultaneously improve the invisibility and revealing quality of covert communication, this paper proposes a Contrastive Noise-Guided Invertible Network (CNGI-Net). Specifically, the Noised-Guided Invertible (NGI) mechanism is first proposed to actively and gradually generate adaptive noise in the forward hiding process using the interaction mechanism. The generated adaptive noise effectively guides and adjusts the cover-secret fusion process, as well as blurs the secret information in the stego images, which can significantly improve the transmission security. Besides, benefiting from the reversible property of NGI, high-quality revealed secret images can also be progressively decoupled from the stego images along the backward flow of NGI. To further ensure the invisibility and security of communication, Contrastive Hiding Learning (CHL) is proposed to improve the cover-stego similarity using the contrastive information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CNGINet significantly promotes concealment security of transmission process and the quality of revealing for covert communication. Especially, the quality of stego and revealed secret images on 1, 2, 3 image hiding has been respectively promoted by 1.53, 0.43, 0.38 dB and 4.26, 3.45, 4.98 dB on ImageNet dataset, compared to SOTA steganography methods.","1558-4127","","10.1109/TCE.2024.3509479","Guangdong International Science and Technology Cooperation Project(grant numbers:2023A0505050108); Guangdong Shenzhen joint Youth Fund(grant numbers:2021A151511074); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176077,62206073); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2023A1515010893); Shenzhen Fundamental Research and Discipline Layout project(grant numbers:JCYJ20210324132210025); Shenzhen Doctoral Initiation Technology Plan(grant numbers:RCBS20221008093222010); Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Novel Security Intelligence Technologies(grant numbers:2022B1212010005); Shenzhen Key Technical Project(grant numbers:JSGG20201103153802006,JSGG20220831092805009,JSGG20220831105603006,KJZD20230923115117033); Shenzhen Pengcheng Peacock Startup Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10780952","Image steganography;covert communication;contrastive noise-guided invertible network (CNGI-Net);noisedguided invertible (NGI);contrastive hiding learning (CHL)","Steganography;Security;Noise;Consumer electronics;Visualization;Image edge detection;Receivers;Inverse problems;Couplings;Contrastive learning","","","","","IEEE","5 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A particularly promising class of circuits in this technology is the printed analog neuromorphic circuits, offering efficient and highly tailored computational functionalities. In this work, we leverage the highly flexible fabrication process of PE to address the bottleneck of PE, i.e., the large feature sizes and low device counts.

Due to the lack of ground-truth for multi-focus image fusion, supervised deep learning methods are deemed inappropriate for this task. In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach for multi-focus image fusion, named Fusion2Void. Fusion2Void ingeniously tackles the challenge of missing ground-truth by framing image inpainting as an auxiliary task. Specifically, Fusion2Void utilizes a fusion network to merge focused regions from multiple source images. Following the fusion process, image patches in the source images are randomly dropped to construct an additional image inpainting task. Subsequently, an image inpainting network uses the fused image as a guide to restore the missing content in the source images. The missing content in the source images includes both focused and defocused regions. Restoring focused image patches is significantly more challenging than restoring their defocused counterparts due to their inclusion of more high-frequency details. If the focused image patches are effectively restored, the repair of the defocused image patches becomes notably easier. Therefore, the image inpainting network implicitly compels the fused image to incorporate all focused content from the source images, as these can be utilized to restore the missing focused regions in the source images perfectly. Based on image inpainting, the fusion network generates ‘all-in-focus’ images in an unsupervised manner. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets highlight Fusion2Void’s state-of-the-art performance relative to other methods.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2024.3502200","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:20720230104); Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF(grant numbers:GZC20233543); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2022M723914,2023M744322); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52105126,61971369,62201588,62271430,82172033,82272071,U19B2031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10757430","Multi-focus image fusion;unsupervised;image inpainting;deep learning","Image fusion;Image restoration;Transforms;Circuits and systems;Kernel;Image segmentation;Image reconstruction;Discrete wavelet transforms;Deep learning;Visualization","","","","","IEEE","19 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Most methods locate forged regions in the form of segmentation and subsequently perform detection, facing challenges such as false detections (i.e., FPs) and inaccurate boundaries. In this work, we suggest rethinking the Image Forgery Detection and Localization (IFDL) task from a regression perspective and propose the CatmullRom Splines-based Regression Network (CSR-Net) to address these issues. Specifically, we first design an adaptive CutmullRom splines fitting scheme to predict coarse forged regions. Subsequently, we develop a novel rescoring mechanism that filters out samples with no response in both the classification and instance branches to reduce false positives. Besides, a learnable texture extraction module decouples horizontal and vertical forgery features, extracting more robust contour representations to further refine boundaries and suppress false detections. Compared to segmentation-based methods our method is simple but effective due to the unnecessity of post-processing. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Particularly, CSR-Net achieves optimal performance on three real-world datasets, indicating the applicability of our method to real scenarios such as social media and multi-tampered regions.","2471-285X","","10.1109/TETCI.2025.3543837","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62302143); Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2308085QF207); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFD2000201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10910224","Image forgery;detection and localization;catmullrom splines;regression methods","Splines (mathematics);Forgery;Location awareness;Electronic mail;Image segmentation;Accuracy;Shape;Process control;Interpolation;Feature extraction","","","","","IEEE","5 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous works focus on monophonic or raw audio generation, while the multi-instrument scenario is under-explored. The challenges associated with dance-driven multi-instrument music (MIDI) generation are twofold: (i) lack of a publicly available multi-instrument MIDI and video paired dataset and (ii) the weak correlation between music and video. To tackle these challenges, we have built the first multi-instrument MIDI and dance paired dataset (D2MIDI). Based on this dataset, we introduce a multi-instrument MIDI generation framework (Dance2MIDI) conditioned on dance video. Firstly, to capture the relationship between dance and music, we employ a graph convolutional network to encode the dance motion. This allows us to extract features related to dance movement and dance style. Secondly, to generate a harmonious rhythm, we utilize a transformer model to decode the drum track sequence, leveraging a cross-attention mechanism. Thirdly, we model the task of generating the remaining tracks based on the drum track as a sequence understanding and completion task. A BERT-like model is employed to comprehend the context of the entire music piece through self-supervised learning. We evaluate the music generated by our framework trained on the D2MIDI dataset and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.","2096-0662","","10.1007/s41095-024-0417-1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10897723","video understanding;music generation;symbolic music;cross-modal learning;self-supervision","Humanities;Music;Feature extraction;Rhythm;Instruments;Transformers;Generators;Noise;Correlation;Annotations","","","","","","20 Feb 2025","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Gabrys",NA; NA; NA,AutonoML: Towards an Integrated Framework for Autonomous Machine Learning,"","2024","","","","","Over the last decade, the long-running endeavour to automate high-level processes in machine learning (ML) has risen to mainstream prominence. Beyond this, an even loftier goal is the pursuit of autonomy, which describes the capability of the system to independently adjust an ML solution over a lifetime of changing contexts. This monograph provides an expansive perspective on what constitutes an automated/autonomous ML system. In doing so, the authors survey developments in hyperparameter optimisation, multicomponent models, neural architecture search, automated feature engineering, meta-learning, multi-level ensembling, dynamic adaptation, multi-objective evaluation, resource constraints, flexible user involvement, and the principles of generalisation. Furthermore, they develop a conceptual framework throughout to illustrate one possible way of fusing high-level mechanisms into an autonomous ML system. This monograph lays the groundwork for students and researchers to understand the factors limiting architectural integration, without which the field of automated ML risks stifling both its technical advantages and general uptake.","","9781638283171","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10443868.pdf&bkn=10443867&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","23 Feb 2024","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Due to the perspective transformation from 3D space to the image and object occlusion, current 2D image attacks are difficult to generalize to 3D detectors and are limited by physical feasibility. In this work, we propose a unified framework to generate physically printable adversarial patches with different attack goals: 1) instance-level hiding—pasting the learned patches to any target vehicle allows it to evade the detection process; 2) scene-level creating—placing the adversarial patch in the scene induces the detector to perceive plenty of fake objects. Both crafted patches are universal, which can take effect across a wide range of objects and scenes. To achieve above attacks, we first introduce the differentiable image-3D rendering algorithm that makes it possible to learn a patch located in 3D space. Then, two novel designs are devised to promote effective learning of patch content: 1) a Sparse Object Sampling Strategy is proposed to ensure that the rendered patches follow the perspective criterion and avoid being occluded during training, and 2) a Patch-Oriented Adversarial Optimization is used to facilitate the learning process focused on the patch areas. Both digital and physical-world experiments are conducted and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches, revealing potential threats when confronted with malicious attacks. We also investigate the defense strategy using adversarial augmentation to further improve the model’s robustness.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2025.3525725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824853","Adversarial attack;Universal patch;3D object detection;Defense","Three-dimensional printing;Detectors;Visualization;Rendering (computer graphics);Solid modeling;Optimization;Cameras;Autonomous vehicles;Perturbation methods;Training","","","","","IEEE","3 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
