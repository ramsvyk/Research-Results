AB In this work, we address the problem of large language model (LLM)
   unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences and associated
   model capabilities (e.g., copyrighted data or harmful content
   generation) while preserving essential model utilities, without the need
   for retraining from scratch. Despite the growing need for LLM
   unlearning, a principled optimization framework remains lacking. To this
   end, we revisit the state-of-the-art approach, negative preference
   optimization (NPO), and identify the issue of reference model bias,
   which could undermine NPO's effectiveness, particularly when unlearning
   forget data of varying difficulty. Given that, we propose a simple yet
   effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that
   'simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the
   lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We also
   provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages, supported by analysis
   using mixtures of Markov chains. Furthermore, we present extensive
   experiments validating SimNPO's superiority over existing unlearning
   baselines in benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, and robustness against
   relearning attacks.

TI Large Language Model Watermark Stealing With Mixed Integer Programming

AB The Large Language Model (LLM) watermark is a newly emerging technique
   that shows promise in addressing concerns surrounding LLM copyright,
   monitoring AI -generated text, and preventing its misuse. The LLM
   watermark scheme commonly includes generating secret keys to partition
   the vocabulary into green and red lists, applying a perturbation to the
   logits of tokens in the green list to increase their sampling
   likelihood, thus facilitating watermark detection to identify AI
   -generated text if the proportion of green tokens exceeds a threshold.
   However, recent research indicates that watermarking methods using
   numerous keys are susceptible to removal attacks, such as token editing,
   synonym substitution, and paraphrasing, with robustness declining as the
   number of keys increases. Therefore, the state-of-the-art watermark
   schemes that employ fewer or single keys have been demonstrated to be
   more robust against text editing and paraphrasing. In this paper, we
   propose a novel green list stealing attack against the state-of-the-art
   LLM watermark scheme and systematically examine its vulnerability to
   this attack. We formalize the attack as a mixed integer programming
   problem with constraints. We evaluate our attack under a comprehensive
   threat model, including an extreme scenario where the attacker has no
   prior knowledge, lacks access to the watermark detector API, and
   possesses no information about the LLM’s parameter settings or watermark
   injection/detection scheme. Extensive experiments on LLMs, such as OPT
   and LLaMA, demonstrate that our attack can successfully steal the green
   list and remove the watermark across all settings.

TI ESpeW: Robust Copyright Protection for LLM-based EaaS via
   Embedding-Specific Watermark

AB Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) is emerging as a crucial role in AI
   applications. Unfortunately, EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction
   attacks, highlighting the urgent need for copyright protection. Although
   some preliminary works propose applying embedding watermarks to protect
   EaaS, recent research reveals that these watermarks can be easily
   removed. Hence, it is crucial to inject robust watermarks resistant to
   watermark removal attacks. Existing watermarking methods typically
   inject a target embedding into embeddings through linear interpolation
   when the text contains triggers. However, this mechanism results in each
   watermarked embedding having the same component, which makes the
   watermark easy to identify and eliminate. Motivated by this, in this
   paper, we propose a novel embedding-specific watermarking (ESpeW)
   mechanism to offer robust copyright protection for EaaS. Our approach
   involves injecting unique, yet readily identifiable watermarks into each
   embedding. Watermarks inserted by ESpeW are designed to maintain a
   significant distance from one another and to avoid sharing common
   components, thus making it significantly more challenging to remove the
   watermarks. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets demonstrate
   that ESpeW can even watermark successfully against a highly aggressive
   removal strategy without sacrificing the quality of embeddings.

AB Acoustic Emission (AE) and Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR) are playing
   an increasingly important role in the field of coal and rock dynamic
   disaster early warning due to their accurate response to the evolution
   process. However, blasting, drilling, and other coal mine technical
   activities are easily to produce interference signals, which seriously
   affect the credibility of early warning information. Moreover,
   unbalanced samples and complex characteristic characterization cannot
   achieve accurate identification. This paper presents a novel
   identification method for effective and interference signal of AE and
   EMR based on generative adversarial learning and image feature mining.
   First, Kalman filter is applied to AE and EMR monitoring signals to
   remove noise and retain key features. The Wasserstein Generative
   Adversarial Network, then, resolves the imbalance between the sample
   numbers of effective and various types of interference signals to ensure
   generalization of the identification. The effective and interference
   signal samples are further converted graphically by Symmetrized Dot
   Pattern, and intuitive different distribution characteristics are
   obtained. Finally, the EfficientNet model accurately identified typical
   effective and six interference signals collected downhole. The practical
   case of a coal mine in Liaoning Province shows that the proposed method
   is feasible and effective, and can provide a basis for reliable early
   warning of coal and rock dynamic disasters.
