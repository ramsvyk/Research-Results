Script as of 08.04 04:00 did not:
- catch 2 of the citations:
  These were "Abstracts from the 56thÂ European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e-Posters" and "Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Interactive e-Posters"
    Should examine why later. Because they were not found as links in the parse_article_links.
    Manually fixed in xlsx file
- provide a unique reference ID for 30+ articles which did not have an author. Instead created ref1 as IDs for everyone.
    Manually fixed in xlsx file
    Problem lies in dealing with no ID or authors for creating a key.
    Should examine fixes later


.txt to .xlsx did not:
properly catch every authors or editor name which contained {\}. Caught many, but not everyone
  Manually fixed in xlsx file
    should examine why or use different one
