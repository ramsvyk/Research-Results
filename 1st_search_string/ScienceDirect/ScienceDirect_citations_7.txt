Abstract: It seems a foregone conclusion that face mask-wearing hinders the interpretation of facial expressions, increasing the risk of interpersonal miscommunication. This research identifies a notable counter-case to this apparent truism. In multiple experiments, perceivers were more accurate distinguishing between genuine and fake smiles when the mouth region was concealed under a mask versus exposed. Masks improved accuracy by shielding perceivers from the undue influence of non-diagnostic cues hidden behind masks. However, perceivers were unaware of the advantage bestowed by masks, holding, instead, the misbelief that masks severely obscure the distinction between genuine and fake smiles. Furthermore, these patterns proved to be culturally invariant rather than culturally contingent, holding true for both Westerners and Easterners.

Abstract: Estimating the trajectory of other vessels is essential when navigating a marine vessel, both as a human navigator and as a machine. By estimating the trajectories of other vessels, sub-systems such as collision avoidance algorithms can plan ahead accordingly in order to avoid conflicts. To estimate the trajectories of other vessels, the use of Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a good candidate data-point, as this is becoming increasingly more common, and in some cases even mandated, on-board vessels. This paper presents a data-driven approach that uses the historical AIS data within a selected area in the Danish waters. The historical data is transformed into a probabilistic heat map using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and is further encoded using a Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) before entered into the estimation scheme. The estimation scheme consists of a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) configuration, which is sampled multiple times, yielding a single trajectory prediction with uncertainty. The performance of the estimation scheme is demonstrated and compared against two other commonly used methods, showing that the probabilistic heat map provides valuable information, compared to the baseline methods.

Abstract: Polymers are an important class of materials with vast arrays of physical and chemical properties and have been widely used in many applications and industrial products. Although there have been many successful polymer design studies, the pace of materials discovery research can be accelerated to meet the high demand for new, functional materials. With the advanced development of artificial intelligence, the use of machine learning has shown great potential in data-driven design and the discovery of polymers to date. Several polymer datasets have been compiled, allowing robust machine learning models to be trained and provide accurate predictions of various polymer properties. Such models are useful for screening promising candidate polymers with high-performing properties prior to lab synthesis. In this review, we focus on the most critical components of polymer design using molecular descriptors and machine learning algorithms. A summary of existing polymer databases is provided, and the different categories of polymer descriptors are discussed in detail. The application of these descriptors in machine learning studies of polymer design is critically reviewed, leading to a discussion of the challenges, opportunities, and future perspectives for polymer research using these advanced computational tools.

Abstract: Phishing attacks are among the most prevalent attack mechanisms employed by attackers. The consequences of successful phishing include (and are not limited to) financial losses, impact on reputation, and identity theft. The paper presents a systematic literature review featuring 248 articles (from the beginning of 2018 until March 2023) across the main digital libraries to identify, (1) the existing mitigation strategies against phishing attacks, and the underlying technologies considered in the development of these strategies; (2) the most considered phishing vectors in the development of the mitigation strategies; (3) anti-phishing guidelines and recommendations for organizations and end-users respectively; and (4) gaps and open issues that exist in the state of the art. The paper advocates for the need to consider the abilities of human users during the design and development of the mitigation strategies as only technology-centric solutions will not suffice to cater to the challenges posed by phishing attacks.

Abstract: Metaverse platforms devoted to educational purposes are becoming increasingly popular among educators worldwide due to the benefits they offer in elevating students’ lives. This study explores how immersive platform features, blockchain features, a safe learning environment and new learning models contribute to the educational outcomes. Emerging literature on educational Metaverse platforms has been used to develop a genuine conceptual model. The model was tested using data collected from 100 educators located in different countries from worldwide. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), Random Forest and other different feature importance methods, fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), thematic content analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The application of PLS-SEM outlines that immersive platform features and safe learning environments positively affects educational outcomes. Random Forest and feature importance methods investigate the predictive power of items included in the model, fsQCA reveals the combinations of these factors that lead to high educational outcomes, while the qualitative insights reveal the key themes emerged from educators’ perspectives on the use of Metaverse platforms. This study contributes to Metaverse literature, which is relatively understudied in the educational sector.

Abstract: The obfuscation detection technology is an important auxiliary means of malware detection. Also, for security practitioners, it can carry out automatic obfuscation detection before manual reverse analysis, which helps reverse engineers to perform reverse analysis more specifically. Existing obfuscation detection methods are mainly for Android applications and based on traditional machine learning, whose detection granularity is coarse, generality is poor, and the performance is not good enough. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a function-level obfuscation detection method based on Graph Convolutional Networks for X86 assembly code and Android applications. Firstly, our method is function-level obfuscation detection, and we extract the Control Flow Graph (CFG) of each function as its feature, including the adjacency matrix and the basic block feature matrix. Secondly, we build a hybrid neural network model GCN-LSTM as our obfuscation detection model, which combines the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Finally, we conduct experiments using real-world open-source programs and compare results with baseline methods. For function-level detection, the accuracy of our method is 94.7575% for X86 assembly code and 98.9457% for Android applications, both of which are better than baseline methods. For APK-level detection, our method can almost completely detect the obfuscated APKs. Experimental results show that our method performs well for both X86 assembly code and Android applications and is superior to the baseline methods in both function-level detection and APK-level detection. Our research showcases a successful application of the Graph Convolutional Network and the Control Flow Graph on code obfuscation detection problems.

Abstract: In the context of rapid digitization in industrial environments, how effective are advanced unsupervised learning models, particularly hybrid autoencoder models, at detecting anomalies in industrial control system (ICS) datasets? This study is crucial because it addresses the challenge of identifying rare and complex anomalous patterns in the vast amounts of time series data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which can significantly improve the reliability and safety of these systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid autoencoder model, called ConvBiLSTM-AE, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to more effectively train complex temporal data patterns in anomaly detection. On the hardware-in-the-loop-based extended industrial control system dataset, the ConvBiLSTM-AE model demonstrated remarkable anomaly detection performance, achieving F1 scores of 0.78 and 0.41 for the first and second datasets, respectively. The results suggest that hybrid autoencoder models are not only viable, but potentially superior alternatives for unsupervised anomaly detection in complex industrial systems, offering a promising approach to improving their reliability and safety.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
Single-molecule microscopy is advantageous in characterizing heterogeneous dynamics at the molecular level. However, there are several challenges that currently hinder the wide application of single molecule imaging in bio-chemical studies, including how to perform single-molecule measurements efficiently with minimal run-to-run variations, how to analyze weak single-molecule signals efficiently and accurately without the influence of human bias, and how to extract complete information about dynamics of interest from single-molecule data. As a new class of computer algorithms that simulate the human brain to extract data features, deep learning networks excel in task parallelism and model generalization, and are well-suited for handling nonlinear functions and extracting weak features, which provide a promising approach for single-molecule experiment automation and data processing. In this perspective, we will highlight recent advances in the application of deep learning to single-molecule studies, discuss how deep learning has been used to address the challenges in the field as well as the pitfalls of existing applications, and outline the directions for future development.

Abstract: In this research, we present an updated standard Bangla dataset based on gathered Bangla news articles. In total, more than 1.9 million articles from nine Bangla news websites were gathered; the selection process was led by a number of categories, including sports, economy, politics, local news, tech, tourism, entertainment, education, health, the arts, and many more. The dataset per newspaper contains varying attributes, such as title, content, time, tags, meta, category, etc. This dataset will enable data scientists to investigate and assess theories related to Bangla natural language processing. Furthermore, there is a greater chance that the dataset will be utilized for domain-specific large language models in the context of Bangladesh, and it may be used to develop deep learning and machine learning models that categorize articles according to subjects.

Abstract: Herein, a standalone software equipped with a graphic user interface (GUI) is developed to predict liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC–MS) retention times (RTs) of dansylated metabolites. Dansylation metabolomics strategy developed by Li et al. narrows down a vast chemical space of metabolites into the metabolites containing amines and phenolic hydroxyls. Combined with differential isotope labeling, e.g., 12C-reagent labeled individual samples spiked with a 13C-reagent labeled reference or pooled sample, LC–MS analysis of the dansylated samples enables accurate relative quantification of all labeled metabolites. Herein, the LC–RTs for dansylated metabolites are predicted using an artificial neural network (ANN) machine-learning model. For the ANN modeling, 315 dansylated urine metabolites obtained from the DnsID database are used. The ANN LC–RT prediction model was reliable, with a mean absolute deviation of 0.74 min for the 30 min LC run. In the RT model, a deviation of more than 2 min was observed in only 3.2% of the total 315 metabolites, while a deviation of 1.5 min or more was observed in 11% of the metabolites. Furthermore, it was found that the LC–RT prediction was also reliable even for metabolites containing both amine and phenolic functional groups that can undergo dansylation on either one of the two functional groups, resulting in the generation of two isomeric forms. This RT-prediction model is embedded into a user-friendly GUI and can be used for identifying nontargeted dansylated metabolites with unknown RTs, along with accurate mass measurements. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the developed software can help identify metabolites from a urine sample of an anonymous healthy pregnant woman.

Abstract: This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate the adoption of AI tools among university students, incorporating Ethics and Trust as moderating variables and Subjective Norms as a quadratic variable. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) on a sample of 437 students’ reveals that Perceived Usefulness (PU) significantly influences Attitude Toward Using (ATU), while Perceived Ease of Use (PU) significantly influences Attitude Toward Using (ATU), while Perceived Ease of Use (PEoU) does not, suggesting familiarity with technology reduces the role of ease of use. Ethics positively impacts ATU, highlighting its importance in shaping attitudes. However, Ethics and Trust do not moderate the ATU-Actual Use (AU) relationship, and the hypothesized quadratic effect of Subjective Norms is unsupported, confirming a linear relationship. These findings underscore the direct influence of Ethics and Trust in AI adoption and suggest that educational policies should prioritize ethical AI usage and trust-building to enhance acceptance.

Abstract: During a network analysis of the Dutch astronomer and psychologist Rebekka Aleida Biegel (1886–1943), we stumbled upon an often investigated group photo that most likely shows two of her close friends and a third woman posing with Albert Einstein among others in a chemistry laboratory in Zurich while having a tea party. Using data from the Dark Web, face recognition, open source intelligence (OSINT) tools, and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, we found in total four group portraits of this gathering and were able to determine the true identities of the three women, as well as one of the unknown men in one of the photos, with a very high degree of certainty. Moreover, we determined the exact day and time the photographs were taken: June 30, 1913 around 4:30 PM. After more than a century, the many riddles surrounding these group photos have been solved. By resolving the many questions regarding the (material) historical context of this iconic photograph of Einstein, three years before he published his theory of relativity, new light has been shed on one of the most exciting periods in the history of science. Our innovative research methodology—including AI, Dark Web, and OSINT—enabled us to reconstruct elements of the past of these totally forgotten and heavily marginalized women from many and diverse scattered and unassuming sources and revealed that their place in the history of physics is even more significant than thought. They, too, were part of Einstein’s huge sounding board in the form of his weekly colloquium and had precise astrophysical calculations to add; an indispensible ingredient for proving Einstein’s theory of relativity.

Abstract: In the Maramureș region of Romania there is a large number of historic wooden churches dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. These objects of tangible cultural heritage continue to be exposed to degradation factors. Meanwhile, their interiors hide important and historically valuable artefacts of cultural heritage. Their loss would noticeably impoverish the heritage of local communities. This article presents the problems of 3D scanning the interiors of wooden historic churches, the scanning methodology specifically developed for this occasion, the equipment used and its parameters, and the results of its application. Four examples of wooden churches from the Maramureș region were studied: modern laser scanning technologies with appropriate selection of parameters permits a satisfactorily precise scan of the interior of a wooden religious building, even in difficult lighting conditions. The methodology and equipment choice was proven to be successful and is recommended here for future projects in the region and for structures facing similar challenges.

Abstract: Summary
Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science by improving property prediction and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly, encompassing not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine-learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e., relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich multimodal data available. Here, we introduce multimodal learning for materials (MultiMat), a framework enabling self-supervised multimodal training of foundation models for materials. Using the Materials Project database, we demonstrate the potential of MultiMat by: (1) achieving state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (2) enabling novel and accurate material discovery via latent-space similarity, allowing screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (3) encoding emergent features that correlate with material properties and may provide novel scientific insights.

Abstract: The metaverse is an emerging convergence of technologies (e.g., virtual reality and blockchains) that enables users to experience mixed/extended realities for various legitimate purposes (e.g., gaming, tourism, manufacturing and education). Unfortunately, the crime and security implications of emerging technologies are often overlooked. To anticipate crimes that the metaverse might facilitate, we report the findings of a nominal group technique (NGT) study, which involved a state-of-the-art scoping review of the existing literature and elicitation exercises with two groups of experts (one a diverse group from the UK and Europe, the other representing international law enforcement) with a wide range of expertise. A total of 30 crime threats were identified in the literature or by participants. The elicitation exercises also explored how harmful, frequent, achievable and defeatable participants anticipated that the crimes identified would be. Ratings for these aspects were largely consistent across the two samples, with crimes of a sexual nature (e.g., child sexual abuse material), and crimes against the person (e.g., hate crime) being rated as presenting the highest future risks (i.e. being high harm and high frequency) and being the most difficult to address. The findings illuminate understanding of the most (and least) harmful and likely crime threats the metaverse could facilitate and consequently help stakeholders to prioritise which offences to focus on. In discussing how the crime threats might be addressed, we consider roles and responsibilities and how theory about the management of physical places might inform crime prevention in the metaverse(s).

Abstract: Notable advancements in single-cell omics technologies have not only addressed longstanding challenges but also enabled unprecedented studies of cellular heterogeneity with unprecedented resolution and scale. These strides have led to groundbreaking insights into complex biological systems, paving the way for a more profound comprehension of human biology and diseases. The droplet microfluidic technology has become a crucial component in many single-cell sequencing workflows in terms of throughput, cost-effectiveness, and automation. Utilizing a microfluidic chip to encapsulate and profile individual cells within droplets has significantly improved single-cell research. Therefore, this review aims to comprehensively elaborate the droplet microfluidics-assisted omics methods from a single-cell perspective. The strategies for using droplet microfluidics in the realms of genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics analyses are first introduced. On this basis, the focus then turns to the latest applications of this technology in different sequencing patterns, including mono- and multi-omics. Finally, the challenges and further perspectives of droplet-based single-cell sequencing in both foundational research and commercial applications are discussed.

Abstract: Microglia play a central role in the etiology of many neuropathologies. Transgenic tools are a powerful experiment approach to gain reliable and specific control over microglia function. Adeno-associated virus (AAVs) vectors are already an indispensable tool in neuroscience research. Despite ubiquitous use of AAVs and substantial interest in the role of microglia in the study of central nervous system (CNS) function and disease, transduction of microglia using AAVs is seldom reported. This review explores the challenges and advancements made in using AAVs for expressing transgenes in microglia. First, we will examine the functional anatomy of the AAV capsid, which will serve as a basis for subsequent discussions of studies exploring the relationship between capsid mutations and microglia transduction efficacy. After outlining the functional anatomy of AAVs, we will consider the experimental evidence demonstrating AAV-mediated transduction of microglia and microglia-like cell lines followed by an examination of the most promising experimental approaches identified in the literature. Finally, technical limitations will be considered in future applications of AAV experimental approaches.

This corpus of data offers enormous opportunities for extracting new knowledge and insights—if harnessed effectively. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated remarkable success in data analytics, thus offering a new paradigm for data-intense analyses and scientific investigations through combustion machine learning (CombML). While data-driven methods are utilized in various combustion areas, recent advances in algorithmic developments, the accessibility of open-source software libraries, the availability of computational resources, and the abundance of data have together rendered ML techniques ubiquitous in scientific analysis and engineering. This article examines ML techniques for applications in combustion science and engineering. Starting with a review of sources of data, data-driven techniques, and concepts, we examine supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised ML methods. Various combustion examples are considered to illustrate and to evaluate these methods. Next, we review past and recent applications of ML approaches to problems in combustion, spanning fundamental combustion investigations, propulsion and energy-conversion systems, and fire and explosion hazards. Challenges unique to CombML are discussed and further opportunities are identified, focusing on interpretability, uncertainty quantification, robustness, consistency, creation and curation of benchmark data, and the augmentation of ML methods with prior combustion-domain knowledge.

Abstract: This study tackles the complex task of measuring investor sentiment, a latent variable often measured through various proxies. The focus here is on textual sentiment extracted from online sources, specifically news media and social media sentiment. The central inquiry is whether these proxies are equivalent indicators of investor sentiment. Employing firm-level daily sentiment scores for DJIA stocks and leveraging Granger causality and transfer entropy, the research investigates the dynamics of information flow between these proxies. The findings show a prevailing pattern: information predominantly flows from social media to news for the majority of stocks while a reverse relationship is established for some stocks. The variations across stocks suggest that these proxies do not uniformly capture the same underlying phenomena. The study shows the significant role of social media in shaping news media sentiment and prompts considerations about regulating social media platforms in the context of their impact on financial markets.

Abstract: Recognising the increasing complexities posed by climate challenges to urban environments, it is crucial to develop holistic capabilities for urban areas to effectively respond to climate-related risks, forming the backbone of sustainable urban planning strategies and demanding a comprehensive understanding of urban climate justice. It requires a thorough examination of how climate change exacerbates social, economic, and environmental inequalities within urban settings, which requires a series of sophisticated spatial modellings and relies on data collected periodically. This paper introduces a novel dual-GNN approach, Multi-Hyper Graph Neural Network (MHGNN), with street view imagery as input. The proposed model integrates a multigraph and a hypergraph to model intricate spatial patterns for classifying urban climate justice. The multigraph component of the MHGNN captures spatial proximity and pair-wise connections between urban areas to assess climate impacts. Meanwhile, the hypergraph component addresses higher-order dependencies by incorporating hyperedges that connect multiple geographic areas based on their similarities, thus capturing the multi-faceted relationships among areas with comparable geographic characteristics. By harnessing the strengths of both multigraph and hypergraph structures, the MHGNN provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatial dynamics of urban climate justice. It achieves nearly a 24% performance improvement compared to conventional spatial modelling methods, establishing it as a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers in this domain.

Abstract: Objective
The primary aim of the current study was to determine whether adults who stutter (AWS) present with anomalous periodic beta (β) rhythms when compared to typically fluent adults in the eyes-open resting state. A second aim was to determine whether lower β power in the RS is related to a measure of β event-related desynchronization (ERD) during syllable sequence execution.
Methods
EEG data was collected from 128 channels in a 5 min, eyes-open resting state condition and from a syllable sequence repetition task. Temporal independent component analysis (ICA) was used to separate volume conducted EEG sources and to find a set of component weights common to the RS and syllable repetition task. Both traditional measures of power spectral density (PSD) and parameterized spectra were computed for components showing peaks in the β band (13–30 Hz). Parameterization was used to evaluate separable components adjusted for the 1/f part of the spectrum.
Results
ICA revealed frontal-parietal midline and lateral sensorimotor (μ) components common to the RS and a syllable repetition task with peaks in the β band. The entire spectrum for each component was modeled using the FOOOF algorithm. Independent samples t-tests revealed significantly lower periodic β in midline central-parietal and lateral sensorimotor components in AWS. Regression analysis suggested a significant relationship between left periodic sensorimotor β power in the RS and ERD during syllable sequence execution.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that periodic β peaks in the spectrum are related to hypothesized underlying pathophysiological differences in stuttering, including midline rhythms associated the default mode network (DMN) and lateral sensorimotor rhythms associated with the control of movement.

Abstract: Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing possesses advantages of high deposition rate and low cost compared with other metal additive manufacturing processes. However, potential defects may occur during the process, such as pores, cracks, lack of fusion, inclusions, delamination, and geometrical deviations. These defects are undesirable and have negative effects. To optimize the performance of the as-built components, and to reduce the potential defects, a feasible solution is to conduct in-process sensing and provide feedback to the control system. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of recent progress on sensing technologies, such as optical, acoustic, vision, thermal, and multiple signals-based sensing technologies, and the application of machine learning to enhance the ability to extract the needed feedback from the in-process monitoring raw data. Effective monitoring of different types of defects typically requires different sensing technologies, focus points, and attentions. Multi-sensor-based sensing systems may thus be needed to provide full-scale information. These necessities include the need for in-time data fusion and more complex data processing. This review analyzes recently explored sensing technologies for their principles and remaining challenges to provide directions for future invention, exploration, and investigation.

Abstract: Background
Arts-based educational methodologies have been implemented in nursing and other health disciplines to promote person-centered approaches to care. Readers Theatre has been applied as a tool to promote compassionate and holistic approaches to care. Readers Theatre is a form of drama that requires participants to read aloud a scripted narrative to the audience.
Objectives
To examine the extant literature on experiences of adult learners and educators in utilizing Readers Theatre, and its potential suitability for nurse education. The review question was: “What are the learning experiences of adult students and the teaching experiences of educators in the uptake of Readers Theatre?”
Design and data sources
Scoping review guidelines proposed by Arksey and O'Malley were adopted. Academic databases searches were carried out in ProQuest, JSTOR, Scholars Portal, EBSCO, Web of Science, PubMed, Expanded Academic ASAP, and Scopus.
Review methods
The search and keyword strategy was developed by two reviewers and approved by the lead author, and a librarian. All titles and abstracts were individually examined by the two reviewers with discrepancies discussed and resolved by both parties. Data were extracted for thematic analysis.
Results
A total of 31 studies were selected for the final sample. Four themes were identified within the scoping review relevant to Readers Theatre teaching-learning experiences: 1) principles and characteristics; 2) awareness, understanding, caring and empathy; 3) cross-disciplinary collaboration, interdisciplinary education, and knowledge dissemination; and 4) promoting students' skills.
Conclusions
Readers Theatre has the potential to be utilized within a nursing curriculum, and particularly in theory and substantive class-based courses, through active group learning, in the application phase of knowledge acquisition.

Abstract: The quest for novel materials used in technologies demanding extreme performance has been accelerated by advances in computational materials screening, additive manufacturing routes, and characterization probes. Despite tremendous progress, the pace of adoption of new materials has still not met the promise of global initiatives in materials discovery. This challenge is particularly acute for structural materials with thermomechanical and environmental demands whose performance depends on microstructure as well as material composition. In this prospective article, we review advances in high-throughput mechanical testing, and the associated specimen fabrication, materials characterization, and modeling tasks that show promise for acceleration of the materials development cycle. We identify a critical need to develop rapid testing and characterization strategies that faithfully reproduce design-relevant properties and circumvent the time and expense of conventional high fidelity testing. We identify small-scale mechanical testing workflows that can incorporate real-time decision making based on feedback from multimodal characterization and computational modeling. These workflows will require site-specific specimen fabrication procedures that are agnostic to the synthesis route and have the ability to modulate microstructure and defect characteristics. We close our review by conceptualizing a fully integrated high-throughput testing platform that addresses the speed-fidelity tradeoff in pursuit of a design-relevant suite of properties for new materials.

Abstract: Writing a story is never easy. Even experienced writers sometimes unintentionally omit information from their writings, and it makes the stories not understandable from others. Complementing such unintentionally omitted information using a computer is helpful in providing writing support. Recently, in the field of story understanding and generation, story completion (SC) was proposed to generate the missing parts of an incomplete story. Although its applicability is limited because it requires that the user have prior knowledge of the missing part of a story, missing position prediction (MPP) can be used to compensate for this problem. MPP aims to predict the position of the missing part, but the prerequisite knowledge that “one sentence is missing” is still required. In this study, we propose Variable Number MPP (VN-MPP), a new MPP task that removes this restriction; that is, the task to predict multiple missing sentences or to judge whether there are no missing sentences in the first place. We also propose two methods for this new MPP task. One solves this task end-to-end, while the other learns the two modules separately. The latter allows the writer more flexibility in using the information by making the intermediate outputs between the modules explicit. Based on the novel task, we developed a creative writing support system, COMPASS. The results of a user experiment involving professional creators who write texts in Japanese confirm the efficacy and utility of the developed system. This study aimed to propose a creation support system and, at the same time, to build a relationship of trust between creators and researchers to lay the groundwork for future research and development of creation support AI.

Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) is promising to solve the difficulty of predicting the adsorption of various organic pollutants on carbonaceous materials. This study highlights how ML advances the adsorption research, emphasizes the robust model construction specialized for presenting various application scenarios of adsorption models. We introduce, for the first time, a systematic data preparation workflow tailored for optimizing adsorption studies. Emphasis is given to addressing key challenges in data preparation, including managing adsorption datasets, preventing data leakage, and choosing descriptors wisely. Various algorithms used in 39 previous related studies were included in statistical analysis, and the applications of emerging algorithms in adsorption were prospected. For the data-driven model, the application of importance analysis is beneficial for comprehending adsorption mechanisms, transforming the black-box models into a glass-box ones. It facilitates the identification of primary features governing the adsorption of distinct emerging contaminants and the optimized design of efficient carbonaceous adsorbents. In addition, this review provides prospects for the advanced ML applications in adsorption research, such as its integration with reinforcement learning policies. We also explore the potential of ML in addressing the complexities associated with multi-component adsorption. In sum, this review offers unprecedented illumination into the opportunities and challenges posed by ML in the realm of aqueous adsorption processes.

Abstract: About 6.7% of global greenhouse gas emissions is caused by household cooking activities and thus it is of significance to identify research gaps between current studies and future directions in the context of carbon neutrality. To this end, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is used to review a total of 1440 household cooking studies from international journals written in English between 1983 and 2021. The textual mining technique helps to identify 20 topics in machine-learning sense, involving 8 research disciplines. In addition to energy field, household cooking is most relevant to disciplines of Multidisciplinary, Clinical Medicine, Chemistry, Economics and Business, and Geosciences. Energy ladder hypothesis and energy poverty are the most prevalent topics and asymmetric dependence relationships are unveiled among the 20 topics. Almost all cooking topics focus on health risk elimination and the transition to cleaner fuels while the target of carbon neutrality has not been adequately considered. The practical cooking fuel transition pathway, health co-benefits, impacts of the shift in cooking methods and practice on cultural diversity and human society driven by carbon neutrality constitute potential research directions. The machine-learning literature review research framework used in the study can be generalized in era of big data.

Abstract: Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest inpatient surgical procedure in the elderly, nationwide. Due to the increasing number of TJA patients and advancements in healthcare, there is a growing number of scientific articles being published in a daily basis. These articles offer important insights into TJA, covering aspects like diagnosis, prevention, treatment strategies, and epidemiological factors. However, there has been limited effort to compile a large-scale text dataset from these articles and make it publicly available for open scientific research in TJA. Rapid yet, utilizing computational text analysis on these large columns of scientific literatures holds great potential for uncovering new knowledge to enhance our understanding of joint diseases and improve the quality of TJA care and clinical outcomes. This work aims to build a dataset entitled HexAI-TJAtxt, which includes more than 61,936 scientific abstracts collected from PubMed using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms within “MeSH Subheading” and “MeSH Major Topic,” and Publication Date from 01/01/2000 to 12/31/2022. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at https://github.com/pitthexai/HexAI-TJAtxt, and it will be updated frequently in bi-monthly manner from new abstracts published at PubMed.

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have taken the world by storm. Initially started as an art/game experiment, the NFT has given rise to a new form of entrepreneurship in the virtual world with massive opportunities and affordances. However, research into the entrepreneurial aspect of NFTs and the role of agency in the process is limited. In this article, I examine the concept of NFT-enabled Entrepreneurship (or NFTE). I first identify the main characteristics of NFTs, then define NFTE and discuss the related assumptions, and finally propose a conceptual framework for NFTE and investigate its enablers. I conclude by proposing NFTE as a novel domain of entrepreneurship theory and practice with extensive new research opportunities, and the plausibility of using NFT as an alternative mode of knowledge production in which scholars become “NFT creators.”

Abstract: AI based tools such as ChatGPT have presented many challenges to educators since they entered the scene in 2022. We present our effort to coexist with ChatGPT in the classroom, developing an exercise for first year writing students to use ChatGPT while revising papers. The effectiveness of this activity was determined using pretest/posttest surveys (n = 64 and 53) and one- page reflective essays. Survey results indicated that students had largely positive appraisals of the different elements of the exercise, describing them as useful without reducing their appreciation of writing as an essential skill for the future. Yet, student writing self-efficacy also did not improve after working with ChatGPT. Qualitative responses were often positive but students frequently reported frustrations with ChatGPT rewriting work when told not to and providing only generic feedback. We offer our exercise as a means to engage students in critical thought about ChatGPT's uses, limitations, and implications for academic integrity. We suggest ways to iterate on this tool and to incorporate it in future work but emphasize that students must be taught to use AI tools with considerable skepticism.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence systems are used more and more nowadays, from the application of decision support systems to autonomous vehicles. Hence, the widespread use of AI systems in various fields raises concerns about their potential impact on human safety and autonomy, especially regarding fair decision-making. In our research, we primarily concentrate on aspects of non-discrimination, encompassing both group and individual fairness. Therefore, it must be ensured that decisions made by such systems are fair and unbiased. Although there are many different methods for bias mitigation, few of them meet existing legal requirements. Unclear legal frameworks further worsen this problem. To address this issue, this paper investigates current state-of-the-art methods for bias mitigation and contrasts them with the legal requirements, with the scope limited to the European Union and with a particular focus on the AI Act. Moreover, the paper initially examines state-of-the-art approaches to ensure AI fairness, and subsequently, outlines various fairness measures. Challenges of defining fairness and the need for a comprehensive legal methodology to address fairness in AI systems are discussed. The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on fairness in AI and highlights the importance of meeting legal requirements to ensure fairness and non-discrimination for all data subjects.

Abstract: Batteries are vital energy storage carriers in industry and in our daily life. There is continued interest in the developments of batteries with excellent service performance and safety. Traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches have the limitations of high-cost and low-efficiency. Atomistic computational simulations are relatively expensive and take long time to screen massive materials. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) has brought innovations in many fields and has also changed the paradigm of the battery research. Numerous ML applications have emerged in the battery community, such as novel materials discovery, property prediction, and characterization. In this review, we introduced the workflow of ML, where the task, data, feature engineering, and evaluation were involved. Several typical ML models used in batteries were highlighted. In addition, we summarized the applications of ML for the discovery of novel materials, and for property and battery state prediction. The challenges for the application of ML in batteries were also discussed.

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of nanoporous materials that are widely used in various emerging fields due to their large specific surface area, high porosity and tunable pore size. Its excellent chemical tunability provides a wide material space, in which tens of thousands of MOFs have been synthesized. However, it is impossible to explore such a vast chemical space through trial-and-error methods, making it difficult to achieve custom design of high-performance MOFs for specific applications. Machine learning (ML) is a powerful tool for guiding materials design and preparation by mining the hidden knowledge in data, and can even make prediction of material properties in seconds. This review aims to provide readers with a new perspective on how ML has been changing the research and development paradigm of MOFs. The four main data sources for MOFs and how to select the suitable features (descriptors) are firstly presented to enable the reader to quickly acquire data and carry out machine learning. Moreover, the application of ML in the development of MOFs is highlighted from the perspectives of performance prediction, rational design and intelligent synthesis. Finally, the future challenges and opportunities of combining ML with MOFs from the points of view of data and algorithms are proposed. This review will provide instructive guidance for ML-assisted MOFs research.

Abstract: Introduction
Though exercise during pregnancy can yield important maternal benefits, most pregnant women in China do less aerobic exercise than is currently recommended. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of physical exercise among pregnant women and to identify perceived barriers to and facilitators of exercise participation.
Methods
Purposive sampling was used to recruit 40 pregnant women attending prenatal visits at an obstetrics outpatient department of a tertiary general hospital in Southern China. Individual semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with the verbatim transcripts analyzed through content analysis.
Results
Three main themes emerged from the data: perceptions and patterns of exercise; concerns and hesitations about participating in exercise; and determinants of adoption and maintenance of exercise participation. Though pregnant women recognised their need for physical exercise instruction, their demands remained unmet due to a combination of factors such as lack of knowledge, confidence, and support, and concerns about safety.
Discussion
The findings of this study suggest that the provision of tailored exercise programs for pregnant women, which include education, reassurance, motivational strategies, and lay and professional support, may help improve knowledge, allay concerns, boost confidence, and bolster support when doing physical exercise.

Abstract: The primary challenge in diagnosing ocular diseases in canines based on images lies in developing an accurate and reliable machine learning method capable of effectively segmenting and diagnosing these conditions through image analysis. Addressing this challenge, the study focuses on developing and rigorously evaluating a machine learning model for diagnosing ocular diseases in canines, employing the U-Net neural network architecture as a foundational element of this investigation. Through this extensive evaluation, the authors identified a model that exhibited good reliability, achieving prediction scores with an Intersection over Union (IoU) exceeding 80 %, as measured by the Jaccard index. The research methodology encompassed a systematic exploration of various neural network backbones (VGG, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet) and the U-Net model, combined with an extensive model selection process and an in-depth analysis of a custom training dataset consisting of historical images of different medical symptoms and diseases in dog eyes. The results indicate a fairly high degree of accuracy in the segmentation and diagnosis of ocular diseases in canines, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world applications. In conclusion, this potentially makes a significant contribution to the field by utilizing advanced machine-learning techniques to develop image-based diagnostic routines in veterinary ophthalmology. This model's successful development and validation offer a promising new tool for veterinarians and pet owners, enhancing early disease detection and improving health outcomes for canine patients.

Abstract: Due to the fast spread of data through digital media, individuals and societies must assess the reliability of information. Deepfakes are not a novel idea but they are now a widespread phenomenon. The impact of deepfakes and disinformation can range from infuriating individuals to affecting and misleading entire societies and even nations. There are several ways to detect and generate deepfakes online. By conducting a systematic literature analysis, in this study we explore automatic key detection and generation methods, frameworks, algorithms, and tools for identifying deepfakes (audio, images, and videos), and how these approaches can be employed within different situations to counter the spread of deepfakes and the generation of disinformation. Moreover, we explore state-of-the-art frameworks related to deepfakes to understand how emerging machine learning and deep learning approaches affect online disinformation. We also highlight practical challenges and trends in implementing policies to counter deepfakes. Finally, we provide policy recommendations based on analyzing how emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be employed to detect and generate deepfakes online. This study benefits the community and readers by providing a better understanding of recent developments in deepfake detection and generation frameworks. The study also sheds a light on the potential of AI in relation to deepfakes.

Abstract: Individualised management of obesity remains challenging and, to date, most treatment is based on clinical judgement. This study aimed to develop and validate a novel questionnaire-based tool to identify three pre-defined eating behavior (EB) traits, emotional eating, reduced satiety (constant hunger) and reduced satiation (feasters) that may predict selective medication response given their targeted actions. We recruited 977 individuals from a tertiary academic diabetes clinic to participate in this two-phase validation study. Participants self-reported weight management activities and were asked to self-assess their EB characteristics. The initial questionnaire included 42 visual analogue scale questions. In Phase I, 729 participants completed the questionnaire, including Māori (11.8%) and Pacific peoples (19.3%). After random division of the study sample, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) confirmed a three-factor model as the best fit. Stepwise removal of items with inadequate factor loading retained 27 of 42 items, which accounted for 96% of the variance. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), performed on the second half of the sample, demonstrated good model fit with the final 27-item questionnaire. Internal consistency was high for factor (α = 0.82–0.95) and demographic subgroups, and similar to those obtained in the EFA. Test-retest reliability in a subset of 399 participants who repeated the questionnaire after a four-week interval (Phase II) showed moderate to good reliability. Participants classified into one of three EB types based on the highest median score among the factors. Test-retest reliability was robust for emotional eaters (71.25%) and constant hunger (68.9%). The correlation between aggregate EB score (sum of three EB scores) and BMI was significant (Spearman rho = 0.314, P = .0005). The questionnaire reliably identified three distinct EB traits, which may be informative for precision medicine applications for obesity management.

Abstract: Digital steganography has a long history, starting to be developed in the 90s until now. The main aspects of early steganography are security, imperceptibility, and payload. Security is an essential aspect of steganography, where its development competes with the steganalysis method. The development of steganographic methods is not only based on statistics but also involves adaptive methods, machine learning, artificial intelligence, generative adversarial networks (GAN), convolution neural networks (CNN), coverless techniques, etc. Several new methods add robustness as an important aspect. This makes the development of steganographic methods more varied and generally focuses the goal of the method on one or two aspects. Nowadays, steganography articles, especially surveys, rarely explicitly classify steganography based on its goals. So this survey contributes to classifying steganographic research based on goals and its assessments. This paper also reviews the use of assessment tools in depth because it is closely related to the goal of steganography. Challenges or issues, methods, developments, and popular datasets are also reviewed. Steganalysis literature was also added to improve the quality of the study and analysis. Finally, this survey provides discussion, investigation, critical analysis, and explicit summary so novice researchers can more easily understand image steganography development.

The European AI liability directives – Critique of a half-hearted approach and lessons for the future,

Abstract: The optimal liability framework for AI systems remains an unsolved problem across the globe. With ChatGPT and other large generative models taking the technology to the next level, solutions are urgently needed. In a much-anticipated move, the European Commission advanced two proposals outlining the European approach to AI liability in September 2022: a novel AI Liability Directive (AILD) and a revision of the Product Liability Directive (PLD). They constitute the final cornerstone of AI regulation in the EU. Crucially, the liability proposals and the proposed EU AI Act are inherently intertwined: the latter does not contain any individual rights of affected persons, and the former lack specific, substantive rules on AI development and deployment. Taken together, these acts may well trigger a “Brussels effect” in AI regulation, with significant consequences for the US and other countries. Against this background, this paper makes three novel contributions. First, it examines in detail the liability proposals and shows that, while making steps in the right direction, they ultimately represent a half-hearted approach: if enacted as foreseen, AI liability in the EU will primarily rest on disclosure of evidence mechanisms and a set of narrowly defined presumptions concerning fault, defectiveness and causality. Hence, second, the article suggests amendments to the proposed AI liability framework. They are collected in a concise Annex at the end of the paper. I argue, inter alia, that the dichotomy between the fault-based AILD Proposal and the supposedly strict liability PLD Proposal is fictional and should be abandoned; that an EU framework for AI liability should comprise one fully harmonizing regulation instead of two insufficiently coordinated directives; and that the current proposals unjustifiably collapse fundamental distinctions between social and individual risk by equating high-risk AI systems in the AI Act with those under the liability framework. Third, based on an analysis of the key risks AI poses, the final part of the paper maps out a road for the future of AI liability and regulation, in the EU and beyond. More specifically, I make four key proposals. Effective compensation should be ensured by combining truly strict liability for certain high-risk AI systems with general presumptions of defectiveness, fault and causality in cases involving SMEs or non-high-risk AI systems. The paper introduces a novel distinction between illegitimate- and legitimate-harm models to delineate strict liability's scope. Truly strict liability should be reserved for high-risk AI systems that, from a social perspective, should not cause harm (illegitimate-harm models, e.g., autonomous vehicles or medical AI). Models meant to cause some unavoidable harm by ranking and rejecting individuals (legitimate-harm models, e.g., credit scoring or insurance scoring) may merely face rebuttable presumptions of defectiveness and causality. General-purpose AI systems and Foundation Models should only be subjected to high-risk regulation, including liability for high-risk AI systems, in specific high-risk use cases for which they are deployed. Consumers, in turn, ought to be liable based on regular fault, in general. Furthermore, innovation and legal certainty should be fostered through a comprehensive regime of safe harbours, defined quantitatively to the best extent possible. Moreover, trustworthy AI remains an important goal for AI regulation. Hence, the liability framework must specifically extend to non-discrimination cases and provide for clear rules concerning explainability (XAI). Finally, awareness for the climate effects of AI, and digital technology more broadly, is rapidly growing in computer science. In diametrical opposition to this shift in discourse and understanding, however, EU legislators have long neglected environmental sustainability in both the draft AI Act and the proposed liability regime. To counter this, I propose to jump-start sustainable AI regulation via sustainability impact assessments in the AI Act and sustainable design defects in the liability regime. In this way, the law may help spur not only fair AI and XAI, but also sustainable AI (SAI).

Abstract: Summary
Fertilization, the basis for sexual reproduction, culminates in the binding and fusion of sperm and egg. Although several proteins are known to be crucial for this process in vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using an AlphaFold-Multimer screen, we identified the protein Tmem81 as part of a conserved trimeric sperm complex with the essential fertilization factors Izumo1 and Spaca6. We demonstrate that Tmem81 is essential for male fertility in zebrafish and mice. In line with trimer formation, we show that Izumo1, Spaca6, and Tmem81 interact in zebrafish sperm and that the human orthologs interact in vitro. Notably, complex formation creates the binding site for the egg fertilization factor Bouncer in zebrafish. Together, our work presents a comprehensive model for fertilization across vertebrates, where a conserved sperm complex binds to divergent egg proteins—Bouncer in fish and JUNO in mammals—to mediate sperm-egg interaction.

Abstract: Objective
A core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme to genotype and identify potential risk clonal groups (CGs) in Proteus mirabilis.
Methods
In this work, we propose a publicly available cgMLST scheme for P. mirabilis using chewBBACA. In total 72 complete P. mirabilis genomes, representing the diversity of this species, were used to set up a cgMLST scheme targeting 1,842 genes, 635 unfinished (contig, chromosome, and scaffold) genomes were used for its validation.
Results
We identified a total of 205 CGs from 695 P. mirabilis strains with regional distribution characteristics. Of these, 159 unique CGs were distributed in 16 countries. CG20 and CG3 carried large numbers of shared and unique antibiotic resistance genes. Nine virulence genes (papC, papD, papE, papF, papG, papH, papI, papJ, and papK) related to the P fimbrial operon that cause severe urinary tract infections were only found in CG20. These CGs require attention due to potential risks.
Conclusion
This research innovatively performs high-resolution molecular typing of P. mirabilis using whole-genome sequencing technology combined with a bioinformatics pipeline (chewBBACA). We found that the CGs of P. mirabilis showed regional distribution differences. We expect that our research will contribute to the establishment of cgMLST for P. mirabilis.

Abstract: DNA methylation constitutes an important form of epigenetic modification that can regulate gene expression through the addition of methyl groups to specific positions on DNA without modifying the DNA sequence. High levels of DNA methylation have been implicated in the progression of cancer; thus, DNA demethylation therapy can be considered a potential therapeutic strategy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), essential epigenetic regulators, play pivotal roles in cancer development. In DNA demethylation therapy, miRNAs can regulate DNA methylation-related proteins to reduce or reverse DNA methylation levels and restore normal gene expression. Nanomaterials possess distinctive physicochemical properties that facilitate the efficient delivery of miRNAs to target cells. Through the optimization of the surface properties and structure of nanomaterials, their loading capacity and delivery efficiency of miRNAs can be further enhanced. Recently, nanomedicines loaded with miRNAs have been continuously developed for cancer demethylation therapy. Herein, we concisely review the relationship between miRNAs and cancer DNA methylation, the mechanisms of cancer DNA methylation, and the advances in cancer DNA demethylation treatment for nanomedicines loaded with miRNAs, with the intent of offering novel insights into cancer demethylation therapy.

Abstract: The job market is evolving continuously due to changes in economic landscapes, technological improvements, and skill requirements. In the era of digitalization, a wealth of data is becoming available, opening up new opportunities for labor market analysis. Many stakeholders can make informed decisions if they benefit from accurate and timely insights about the job market. However, traditional data sources and methods used for labor market analysis often fall short of capturing the diversity and trends of the evolving job market. Recently, researchers started exploring various data sources by leveraging data science techniques, which makes information extraction achievable. This survey reviews recent research published between 2015 and 2022 on labor market analytics through data science techniques and discusses future research directions. 101 primary studies were classified and evaluated to identify the data sources utilized for job market analysis; the skill extraction methods and their type; the occupation and sector identification methods; and the application of the study conducted. Finally, we explore potential avenues for future research in this area.

Abstract: The digital technologies employed in archaeology since the 1990s have progressively and experimentally been utilized over the last two decades to document and re-present the ancient polychromy of Greek and Roman marble artworks. Given that this remains a developing field of investigation and application, this study offers, for the first time, a systematic review of the endeavours undertaken thus far in implementing information technology for the documentation, analysis, reconstruction, visualization, and presentation of ancient polychromy. This overview is supported by a literature review and existing implementations, organized into methods and techniques employed for 3D colour preservation, analysis, and reconstruction, as well as those used for the visualization and dissemination of findings. The goal is to identify gaps and provide intriguing insights for future research concerning the use of digital technologies as an essential tool in the stages of documenting and disseminating ancient polychromy in architecture and archaeological artefacts. This, in turn, aims to encourage data sharing, contribute to the dissemination of science-based knowledge and resolve substantial barriers associated with the long-term retention of digital data.

Abstract: The detection of Artificial Intelligence-Generated (AIG) images plays an important role in verifying the authenticity and originality of digital images. However, recent advancements in state-of-the-art image generation methods have significantly challenged the ability to differentiate AIG images from natural photographs (NP). To address this issue, a novel approach based on deep trace representations and dual-branch interactive feature fusion is presented. Firstly, a global feature extraction module that leverages attention-based MobileViT (AT-MobileViT) is designed to learn the deep representations of the global trace information. Besides, we apply multiple enhanced residual blocks to extract discriminative multi-scale features. After that, a low-level feature extraction module incorporating a channel-spatial attention (CSA) block is also carefully employed to enhance the learning of trace representations. To facilitate the capture of complementary information between features, a dual-branch interactive feature fusion module is introduced by reshaping feature vectors into interactive matrices. By conducting experiments on both seen and unseen images, results demonstrate the better performance and robustness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Predicting the difficulty of playing a musical score is essential for structuring and exploring score collections. Despite its importance for music education, the automatic difficulty classification of piano scores is not yet solved, mainly due to the lack of annotated data and the subjectiveness of the annotations. This paper aims to advance the state-of-the-art in score difficulty classification with two major contributions. To address the lack of data, we present Can I Play It? (CIPI) dataset, a machine-readable piano score dataset with difficulty annotations obtained from the renowned classical music publisher Henle Verlag. The dataset is created by matching public domain scores with difficulty labels from Henle Verlag, then reviewed and corrected by an expert pianist. As a second contribution, we explore various input representations from score information to pre-trained ML models for piano fingering and expressiveness inspired by the musicology definition of performance. We show that combining the outputs of multiple classifiers performs better than the classifiers on their own, pointing to the fact that the representations capture different aspects of difficulty. In addition, we conduct numerous experiments that lay a foundation for score difficulty classification and create a basis for future research. Our best-performing model reports a 39.5% balanced accuracy and 1.1 median square error across the nine difficulty levels proposed in this study. Code, dataset, and models are made available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Although perceived constraints represent a well-documented concept, little research has specifically addressed vulnerable populations with chronic diseases. This study is among the first in tourism to explore perceived constraints for tourists with chronic diseases. It uses dementia as an example and draws on qualitative and quantitative data. We developed and validated a five-factor, 38-item scale to assess perceived constraints to outbound tourism for people with mild dementia. Factors include perceived incapability and uncertainties; dementia-friendly service access challenges; emotional fulfillment and adjustment challenges; medication management challenges; and travel procedures and financial challenges. Further investigation demonstrated that perceived constraints significantly contribute to this demographic's learned helplessness and negatively affect their future travel intentions. We have thus expanded accessible tourism beyond creating enjoyable experiences to fostering positive travel. Findings can inform experience design and encourage exploration of the travel behaviors of chronically ill individuals.

Abstract: What is the context which gave rise to the obligation to carry out a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment (FRIA) in the AI Act? How has assessment of the impact on fundamental rights been framed by the EU legislator in the AI Act? What methodological criteria should be followed in developing the FRIA? These are the three main research questions that this article aims to address, through both legal analysis of the relevant provisions of the AI Act and discussion of various possible models for assessment of the impact of AI on fundamental rights. The overall objective of this article is to fill existing gaps in the theoretical and methodological elaboration of the FRIA, as outlined in the AI Act. In order to facilitate the future work of EU and national bodies and AI operators in placing this key tool for human-centric and trustworthy AI at the heart of the EU approach to AI design and development, this article outlines the main building blocks of a model template for the FRIA. While this proposal is consistent with the rationale and scope of the AI Act, it is also applicable beyond the cases listed in Article 27 and can serve as a blueprint for other national and international regulatory initiatives to ensure that AI is fully consistent with human rights.

Abstract: Phishing website detection models face challenges such as missing features, limited feature extraction capabilities, and significant computational resource consumption when processing multidimensional features. Additionally, publicly available datasets often lack diversity and scalability, and are vulnerable to disguise attacks, resulting in poor model generalizability.This paper addresses these issues by proposing a multiclass scalable dataset, Crawling2024, collected using a WebDriver-based collector that simulates human operations to avoid attacker disguises. Through data analysis, we identify handcrafted features from access information and URLs. These features help reduce the computational load of deep learning models and expand feature dimensions. Crawling2024 retains data identifiers (IDs), enabling further extension through data scraping.We also introduce a scalable phishing website detection model (SPWDM) that utilizes a dual-branch temporal convolution network (TCN) to extract local correlations and long-term dependencies of domain names. The model incorporates a lightweight spatial-channel (SC) attention mechanism to enhance interactions between channels and space. Additionally, it uses a mask attention mechanism to manage extended features and adjust focus when features are missing. Our feature fusion method combines enhanced features extracted by the dual-branch TCN, with various features processed by the mask attention mechanism.The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed detection method achieves excellent performance, with an accuracy of 97.66% on the Crawling2024 dataset. This is 0.52% to 2.72% higher than other methods, and it maintains a leading position on other public datasets.

Abstract: Smart manufacturing has transformed the role of data in manufacturing, with a significant focus on secure data infrastructure. As factories engage with external data sources, cybersecurity becomes crucial. Blockchain technology is introduced to safeguard this infrastructure, ensuring secure and transparent data flow, which is vital for industries like pharmaceutical, aerospace, automotive, and electronics manufacturing. This review provides a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain architectures, analyzing their working modes, strengths, and weaknesses while identifying appropriate use cases. It also examines consensus algorithms, categorizing them as either crash fault tolerant (CFT) or Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) and further classifies them based on whether they are proof-based or voting-based. The review explores the intrinsic limitations of blockchain systems and highlights specific manufacturing challenges where blockchain can be instrumental. It also discusses the synergy between blockchain and cybersecurity, emphasizing how they work together to enhance security and accountability. The paper concludes by identifying private blockchain as the most suitable architecture for certain manufacturing applications, particularly in supply chain management and machinery control. A SWOT analysis is conducted on this architecture to provide a detailed understanding of its potential and challenges. The review suggests that while no single consensus algorithm is best universally, each has its own merits depending on the application. Lastly, the SWOT analysis serves as a catalyst for future research, guiding efforts to maximize blockchain’s strengths and mitigate its weaknesses in industrial contexts.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unexpected data samples in datasets. Automated anomaly detection is either performed using supervised machine learning models, which require a labelled dataset for their calibration, or unsupervised models, which do not require labels. While academic research has produced a vast array of tools and machine learning models for automated anomaly detection, the research community focused on environmental systems still lacks a comparative analysis that is simultaneously comprehensive, objective, and systematic. This knowledge gap is addressed for the first time in this study, where 15 different supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection models are evaluated on 5 different environmental datasets from engineered and natural aquatic systems. To this end, anomaly detection performance, labelling efforts, as well as the impact of model and algorithm tuning are taken into account. As a result, our analysis reveals the relative strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in an objective manner without bias for any particular paradigm in machine learning. Most importantly, our results show that expert-based data annotation is extremely valuable for anomaly detection based on machine learning.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of peptides and proteins targeted therapeutics is primarily attributed to their inherent advantages, such as precise targeting and the reduction of side effects, compared to traditional nonspecific small molecular drugs. In recent times, another achievement in peptide-based therapeutics is identified in their potential to target intracellular protein–protein interactions (PPI) deemed previously “undruggable”. As a matter of fact, precision targeting of intracellular PPI is a newfound hope for a large number of conditions which had no treatment. The review explores potential intracellular targeting strategies by peptide-based molecules, with their potential mode of activity in biological system, the transport mechanisms involved, targeting strategies and common barriers that need to be overcome. It also discusses the challenges of lab to clinic translation focusing on intracellular delivery of peptides.

Abstract: Summary
Autonomous atomistic computations are excellent tools to accelerate the development of heterogeneous (electro-)catalysts. In this perspective, we critically review the achieved progress to accelerate high-throughput screening aimed at identifying promising catalyst materials via databases, workflow managers, and machine-learning techniques. Outstanding challenges are also discussed extensively: the modification and stability of catalyst surfaces under realistic reaction conditions is key for meaningful predictions. Furthermore, adequately accounting for solvent effects remains a topic of active research particularly relevant for biomass transformations and electrocatalysis. Finally, efficient, autonomous workflows for investigating active sites of amorphous catalysts remain underdeveloped. The computations can also be supplemented with autonomous laboratories, which allow the performance of sophisticated experiments driven by artificial intelligence-augmented design of experiments, reducing human-time investment for optimizing synthesis and reaction conditions as well as catalyst characterizations. The combination of autonomous computations and laboratories promise to power the dearly needed transition to a sustainable chemical industry.

Abstract: Assessment of psychological constructs, such as the Big Five personality traits, has predominantly relied on standardized rating scales. While these scales have advantages, we propose that descriptive word-based responses analyzed with natural language processing (NLP) offer a promising alternative for assessing personality traits. We asked participants (N = 663) to describe either their own personality or a person high in one of the Big Five traits using five words. These responses were then analyzed using large language models, namely BERT and GPT-4, which are known for their high-performance NLP capabilities. The primary aim was to assess the validity of word-based responses analyzed by NLP in comparison to the IPIP-NEO-30 rating scale, a commonly used tool for measuring the Big Five traits. Results showed that descriptive word responses had an average prediction accuracy of up to 10 % higher than the rating scale in categorizing the Big Five traits. Additionally, semantic measures showed higher inter-rater reliability, and observer convergence was greater in assessments of others than in self-reports. These findings suggest that descriptive word-based responses may capture more observable and broad aspects of personality compared to traditional rating scales.

Abstract: Healthcare organizations have realized that Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide a competitive edge through personalized patient experiences, improved patient outcomes, early diagnosis, augmented clinician capabilities, enhanced operational efficiencies, or improved medical service accessibility. However, deploying AI-driven tools in the healthcare ecosystem could be challenging. This paper categorizes AI applications in healthcare and comprehensively examines the challenges associated with deploying AI in medical practices at scale. As AI continues to make strides in healthcare, its integration presents various challenges, including production timelines, trust generation, privacy concerns, algorithmic biases, and data scarcity. The paper highlights that flawed business models and wrong workflows in healthcare practices cannot be rectified merely by deploying AI-driven tools. Healthcare organizations should re-evaluate root problems such as misaligned financial incentives (e.g., fee-for-service models), dysfunctional medical workflows (e.g., high rates of patient readmissions), poor care coordination between different providers, fragmented electronic health records systems, and inadequate patient education and engagement models in tandem with AI adoption. This study also explores the need for a cultural shift in viewing AI not as a threat but as an enabler that can enhance healthcare delivery and create new employment opportunities while emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying operational issues. The necessity of investments beyond finance is discussed, emphasizing the importance of human capital, continuous learning, and a supportive environment for AI integration. The paper also highlights the crucial role of clear regulations in building trust, ensuring safety, and guiding the ethical use of AI, calling for coherent frameworks addressing transparency, model accuracy, data quality control, liability, and ethics. Furthermore, this paper underscores the importance of advancing AI literacy within academia to prepare future healthcare professionals for an AI-driven landscape. Through careful navigation and proactive measures addressing these challenges, the healthcare community can harness AI's transformative power responsibly and effectively, revolutionizing healthcare delivery and patient care. The paper concludes with a vision and strategic suggestions for the future of healthcare with AI, emphasizing thoughtful, responsible, and innovative engagement as the pathway to realizing its full potential to unlock immense benefits for healthcare organizations, physicians, nurses, and patients while proactively mitigating risks.

Abstract: This paper explores advanced music generation through hybrid models combining deep neural networks, machine learning algorithms, variational autoencoders (VAEs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers to create diverse and engaging musical experiences. Our research aims to advance the understanding of music’s impact on our lives and develop methodologies to create diverse and engaging musical experiences tailored to individual preferences. We begin by extracting relevant features from a large and diverse collection of music samples from different genres. These features, encompassing spectral properties, rhythmic patterns, and tonal characteristics, serve as the foundation for our generation models. To generate music, we explore the potential of VAEs, LSTMs, and Transformers, each offering unique capabilities for handling different aspects of the task. VAEs are employed to learn a continuous latent space representation of the music samples, enabling the generation of novel compositions within a specified genre. LSTMs and Transformers, on the other hand, are used to model the temporal dependencies and intricate patterns inherent in music. While not claiming state-of-the-art performance, our approach demonstrates promising outcomes in generation tasks, showcasing its potential to enhance music-related applications such as recommendation systems and creative tools for composers.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing, (AM), includes seven subcategories that can directly manufacture components structures from a computer-designed model layer by layer. Laser-based powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is one of type of the subcategories of AM. L-PBF is a fast and cost-efficient production method that offers the advantages of being implementable with a diverse range of raw materials, possessing a high level of freedom in customization, and producing less waste. L-PBF can potentially enable the production of hierarchically complex shaped electrochemical separation units. This study examines the use of L-PBF for the fabrication of metal electrodes for electrochemical processes. The aim is to address a literature gap by presenting a state-of-the-art review of L-PBF electrodes used in electrochemical cells. The study investigates existing research on electrochemistry and identifies potential benefits from use of L-PBF metal electrodes. Electrochemical reactors in industry require electrodes with a large electrode/electrolyte interface that can hold electrolytes efficiently and reduce the diffusion path of electrons and ions on the active surface of electrode. Meeting these demands require electrodes with specific characteristics such as high surface area and improved mass transport. This review shows that L-PBF can manufacture optimized electrodes satisfying the requirements for electrochemical cells in industrial applications

Abstract: Measuring brand equity is of vital importance to marketing practitioners and scholars. Academics and practitioners have developed a range of tools and metrics for measuring brand equity, but in the fast-paced and transformational digital era, it may be that current metrics are not sufficient. The authors develop a conceptual understanding of the brand equity paradigm using practitioner and scholarly views. A practitioner-focused analysis is given on how companies can best understand and measure brand performance in a digital environment and take actionable insights, using the share of search, digital brand awareness, and digital brand sentiment constructs. The authors argue that digital brand equity metrics cannot be based only on social media and current digital metrics indicators but also must include a human side of the brand and the technology-consumer nuances. The study proposes a research agenda and highlights important research and policy questions in developing digital brand equity.

Abstract: The rising demand for automated methods in the Construction Management Systems (CMS) sector highlights opportunities for the Transformer architecture, which enables pre-training Deep Learning models on large, unlabeled datasets for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, outperforming traditional Recurrent Neural Network models. However, their potential in the CMS domain remains underexplored. Therefore, this research produced the first CMS domain corpora from academic papers and introduced an end-to-end pipeline for pre-training and fine-tuning domain-specific Pre-trained Language Models. Four corpora were constructed and transfer learning was employed to pre-train BERT and RoBERTa using the corpora. The best-performing models were then fine-tuned and outperformed models pre-trained on general corpora. In two key NLP tasks, text classification using an infrastructure condition prediction dataset and named entity recognition using an automatic construction control dataset, domain-specific pre-training improved F1 scores by 5.9% and 8.5%, respectively. These promising results demonstrate extended applicability beyond CMS to the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction sectors.

Abstract: Wild animals are exposed to a variety of anthropogenic stressors that may result in loss of physiological homeostasis. One main consequence of this stress exposure is the increased vulnerability to pathogens. We addressed the hypothesis that energetic unbalance and alterations of immune effectors are key proximate mechanisms underlying this vulnerability, by quantifying the gene expression of magnificent frigatebird Fregata magnificens chicks affected by a highly lethal viral disease, whose appearance is favoured by food limitation in this species. A comparison between chicks with and without visible clinical signs of the disease using strict threshold of significance (p-value adjusted<0.05 and log2 fold-change above 1 or below −1) revealed 86 upregulated and 9 downregulated genes in sick chicks. The main differentially expressed genes with several fold difference between healthy and sick chicks were linked to biotic and external stimuli, inflammation and antifungal/antibacterial activity, signaling, and hydrolase activity. We further followed the chicks for several weeks, to identify chicks that became sick over the course of the study, to assess how the gene expression profile of chicks may predict the response to the disease. A comparison between chicks that remained always healthy and chicks that showed the appearance of visible clinical signs of the disease revealed 4 upregulated and 8 downregulated genes in chicks that became sick. The main differentially expressed genes with several fold difference between the two phenotypes were linked to cell development and differentiation, metabolism, and immunity. The results of our study suggest that alterations of the energetic machinery and of specific immune effectors (e.g. toll-like receptor, tetraspanins) underlie the impact of a viral disease on a free-living vertebrate. Our study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the host-pathogen interaction in wild animals and the physiological pathways involved, and provides insights for effective wildlife disease monitoring and management strategies.

Abstract: A Recommender System (RS) is an integral part of present-day leading web services, such as YouTube, Amazon, Netflix, and many others. Modern RSs are challenged to go beyond their traditional role of predicting user preferences to efficiently provide reliable, carefully personalized, and highly accurate recommendations. This paper thoroughly explores and analyzes state-of-the-art literature surveys on RS to extract important challenges and open issues. Our goal in this paper is to survey the literature to extract essential features of RSs and Blockchain (BC), focusing on their integration. Because of the lack of an existing foundation of BC-based RSs, the intrinsic BC aspects in RSs are identified and described. Integrating BC technology within RSs can achieve many benefits such as transparency, decentralization, and security. To that end, a thorough study of the papers on current BC-based RSs is presented along with a synthesized comprehensive taxonomy. Furthermore, a modular RS architecture, encompassing on-chain and off-chain storage and computation processes, is designed. This paper also includes a thorough discussion on the validity of the proposed architecture, BC limitations concerning RSs, and the derivation of a rich set of pointers to future research directions.

Abstract: Image content identification systems have many applications in industry and academia. In particular, a hash-based content identification system uses a robust image hashing function that computes a short binary identifier summarizing the perceptual content in a picture and is invariant against a set of expected manipulations while being capable of differentiating between different pictures. A common approach to designing these algorithms is crafting a processing pipeline by hand. Unfortunately, once the context changes, the researcher may need to define a new function to adapt. A deep hashing approach exploits the feature learning capabilities in deep networks to generate a feature vector that summarizes the perceptual content in the image, achieving outstanding performance for the image retrieval task, which requires measuring semantic and perceptual similarity between items. However, its application to robust content identification systems is an open area of opportunity. Also, image hashing functions are valuable tools for image authentication. However, to our knowledge, its application to content-preserving manipulation detection for image forensics tasks is still an open research area. In this work, we propose a deep hashing method exploiting the metric learning capabilities in contrastive self-supervised learning with a new modular loss function for robust image hashing. Moreover, we propose a novel approach for content-preserving manipulation detection for image forensics through a sensitivity component in our loss function. We validate our method through extensive experimentation in different data sets and configurations, validating the generalization properties in our work.

Abstract: Authorship Attribution (AA) is crucial for identifying the author of a given text from a pool of suspects, especially with the widespread use of the internet and electronic devices. However, most AA research has primarily focused on high-resource languages like English, leaving low-resource languages such as Bengali relatively unexplored. Challenges faced in this domain include the absence of benchmark corpora, a lack of context-aware feature extractors, limited availability of tuned hyperparameters, and OOV issues. To address these challenges, this study introduces AuthorNet for authorship attribution using attention-based early fusion of transformer-based language models, i.e., concatenation of an embeddings output of two existing models that were fine-tuned. AuthorNet consists of three key modules: Feature extraction, Fine-tuning and selection of best-performing models, and Attention-based early fusion. To evaluate the performance of AuthorNet, a number of experiments using four benchmark corpora have been conducted. The results demonstrated exceptional accuracy: 98.86 ± 0.01%, 99.49 ± 0.01%, 97.91 ± 0.01%, and 99.87 ± 0.01% for four corpora. Notably, AuthorNet outperformed all foundation models, achieving accuracy improvements ranging from 0.24% to 2.92% across the four corpora.

Abstract: In today’s techno-social environment, it is easy to make, store, and share digital recordings, such as photographs, audio fragments, and video streams, at an unprecedented scale. While there are often obvious immediate benefits to making and sharing digital recordings, serious hazards associated with these practices have thus far gone under-appreciated. We contend that today’s digital recording practices threaten to radically alter how we perceive and evaluate ourselves and others, producing an ongoing, socially and morally disruptive shift towards unbounded moralized judgment. The shift toward unbounded moralized judgment in turn poses several hazards, including widespread, difficult-to-restore reputation damage, negatively altered self-perceptions, and the stifling of morally right behavior. Our central claim is that in the current techno-social environment, every individual has a pro tanto reason to avoid being recorded and to avoid recording others. On the occasions where the reasons for recording outweigh those against, more must be done to counteract the hazards introduced by recording. We conclude the paper by outlining possible avenues for technical, regulatory, and societal approaches to mitigating the hazards of unbounded moralized judgment.

Abstract: The current landscape of the perfume industry faces the challenge of enhancing product appeal and captivating consumers through innovation. Integrating multisensory elements into perfume experiences has the potential to drive this innovation forward. This research presents a novel methodology for characterizing sounds that evoke the perception of freshness in fragrances. Three experiments were conducted to explore the transferability of identified sound characteristics into the experience of certain fragrances. Experiment 1 assessed selected sounds to identify auditory parameters that effectively triggered primary freshness attributes. Based on these results, originally composed brand-aligned soundtracks were tested in Experiment 2 using the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate associations with freshness and brand values. Experiment 3 examined whether these soundtracks effectively modulated the implicit olfactory experience of two commercial fragrances. The findings showed that the soundtracks successfully elicited specific enhanced effects in how people implicitly perceived the freshness of a fragrance. These outcomes revealed how soundtracks can enhance the perceptions of freshness attributes (e.g., cold, blue, light) in the fragrance experience, consistencies and variations between self-report and implicit measures, and practical applications in multisensory strategies for cosmetic companies.

Relational stigma as a social determinant of health: “I'm not what you _____see me as”,

Abstract: Aim
The aim of the paper is to understand how people who use drugs (PWUD) experience stigma. To examine this issue, this paper draws on Bourdieu's logic of practice to understand how social harm emerges relationally between people via ‘mechanisms of stigma’.
Methods
This paper draws on 24 qualitative semi-structured interviews with people who use drugs (heroin, crack/cocaine, amphetamine, ecstasy; 11 men/12 women/1 transgender) living in the northeast of England. Thematic analysis of data was undertaken and coded in Nvivo.
Findings
PWUD experienced stigmatisation relationally with family, employers, health workers, Criminal Justice System, and the public for reasons linked to (but not limited to) their drug use, social class position, and their appearance. Stigmatisation shaped how participants saw themselves as a person ‘lacking’ in a valued or worthy identity. Social relations had detrimental effects on mental and physical health, and how participants accessed health services.
Conclusions
Models of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) currently focus almost entirely on a positivist, material ‘reality’ in which a person lives (housing, employment, food insecurity, healthcare, education, access to services), overlooking the ways in which social relations and a practical ‘mastery’ of social space contribute to health and inequalities. Furthermore, relational stigma shapes our experience of a healthy life; as such, stigma should be regarded as a SDoH as it contributes to a widening of health inequalities and unfairly impacts marginalised people in society.

Abstract: Renewable energies (RE) are rapidly reforming the power sector because they have become more economically competitive, thereby enabling nations to overcome high dependence on energy imports (i.e. reducing energy security concerns), as well as reducing their negative environmental footprints. Therefore, both the public and private sectors need to uncover the future technological trajectory of renewable energy. As part of an entity-linking approach, this paper examines REs developments from 2000 to 2021 and explores high-potential topics by analyzing hot topics during the period to identify evolutionary trends of relevant research interests (using published research papers). The results are analyzed and classified to determine how and when RE development issues “burst” into the public eye. The article tells the story of RE development from the past, the present, and the likely future hot topics for research. We analyze the results and cluster them into five categories: (1) energy sources, (2) sustainable development, (3) technological developments, (4) supply chains, and (5) energy management systems.se Findings reveal signals about the potential future energy market shifts and how REs evolve and contribute to the market. Signals are converted to policies and future market interpretations using an expert-based process. Analysis and methodology outcomes reveal that digital technologies have become an important factor in market changes. The findings of the study highlight how sustainable development actions and digital technologies will likely transform RE supply and management.

Abstract: ChatGPT, an innovative artificial intelligence language model, is attracted significant attention around the world, sparking both enthusiasm and controversy, but identifying its societal impact and addressing its potential concerns necessitate an understanding of the prevailing public's attitudes toward the tool. In this study, we leverage text mining techniques to analyze the sentiments and themes prevalent among Chinese social media discussions of ChatGPT. In total, 96,435 comment data and 55,186 repost data were used, and the results show that public discussions mainly focused on ChatGPT's technical support, AI-related effectiveness, impact on human work, and effects on education and technology. Concerns were related to disinformation risks, technological unemployment, and the human–computer relationship. In addition, we found that social media played a prominent role in information dissemination, while official media and government units demonstrated a limited influence. The insights obtained through this study can inform policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the public of the public's prevailing attitude toward AI technologies, and they can facilitate informed decision-making.

FTA-DETR: An efficient and precise fire detection framework based on an end-to-end architecture applicable to embedded platforms,

Abstract: Timely fire alarms are crucial as they can save lives and avoid major economic losses. However, due to the complexity of the structure, the current mainstream DETR-based fire detection models are problematic in terms of practicality because they require large amounts of memory and long inference times. Meanwhile, high-quality fire detection datasets are very scarce, severely limiting the performance of the algorithms. To address these challenges and improve accuracy in complex fire environments, first, we introduce a dataset quality enhancement framework based on diffusion model (DDPM) to improve the quality of low-quality fire alarm datasets. Second, we propose a novel Deformable-DETR-based fire detection framework (FTA-DETR). Among the innovative optimizations of FTA-DETR, first, we introduce a trainable matrix in the encoder to compute features, which reduces the computational burden of the encoder, highlights compelling features, and significantly reduces the training time. Second, we improve the encoding block by alternately updating high-level and low-level features, greatly reducing the amount of feature computation required for effective detection. This encoder structure is compatible with any state-of-the-art transformer decoder. Next, to accommodate the multi-scale nature of fires and different environmental complexities, we modify the loss function to WiouV3, which not only speeds up the convergence of the model but also improves the performance. Finally, we smoothly combine FTA-DETR with an acceleration engine like TensorRT to improve inference speed with little loss of accuracy. The experiments show that the dataset quality enhancement framework based on the diffusion model generates high quality datasets, and the enhanced dataset can greatly improve the detection performance of FTA-DETR (mAP increased by 2.42%). Meanwhile, FTA-DETR outperforms almost all current fire detection frameworks in terms of detection accuracy and interference resistance, with accuracy reaching 98.32% and 99.21% on the two datasets, Mivia and FireNet, respectively, and precision reaching 94% on the BoWFire dataset. In addition, FTA-DETR after being paired with the TensorRT framework achieves an inference speed of 76 FPS on the Jetson Orin Nano, a small embedded device with very limited computational power. The code is available at https://github.com/wanggoat/FTA-detr.

Abstract: Localization by jointly exploiting multimodal information, like cameras, inertial measurement units (IMU), and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data, is an active key research topic for autonomous embedded systems such as smart glasses or drones. These systems have become topical for acquisition, modeling, and interpretation for scene understanding. The exploitation of different sensor types improves the robustness of the localization, e.g. by merging the accuracy of one sensor with the reactivity of another one in a flexible manner. This chapter presents a survey of the existing multimodal techniques dedicated to the localization of autonomous embedded systems. Both the algorithmic and the hardware architecture sides are investigated in order to provide a global overview of the key elements to be considered when designing these embedded systems. Several applications in different domains (e.g. localization for mapping, pedestrian localization, automotive navigation and mixed reality) are presented to illustrate the importance of such systems nowadays in scene understanding.
