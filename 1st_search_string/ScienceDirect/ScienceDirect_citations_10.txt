Abstract: With recent advances in non-contact sensing technology such as cameras, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, the structural health monitoring (SHM) community has witnessed a prominent growth in deep learning-based condition assessment techniques of structural systems. These deep learning methods rely primarily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN networks are trained using a large number of datasets for various types of damage and anomaly detection and post-disaster reconnaissance. The trained networks are then utilized to analyze newer data to detect the type and severity of the damage, enhancing the capabilities of non-contact sensors in developing autonomous SHM systems. In recent years, a broad range of CNN architectures has been developed by researchers to accommodate the extent of lighting and weather conditions, the quality of images, the amount of background and foreground noise, and multiclass damage in the structures. This paper presents a detailed literature review of existing CNN-based techniques in the context of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. The review is categorized into multiple classes depending on the specific application and development of CNNs applied to data obtained from a wide range of structures. The challenges and limitations of the existing literature are discussed in detail at the end, followed by a brief conclusion on potential future research directions of CNN in structural condition assessment.

Abstract: The Classification of All Living Organisms (also known as the Tree of Life and herein called the Classification of Life) is the most comprehensive, the most tested, the oldest, the best curated, and the most prized scientific document ever produced. In production for over two millennia, thousands of scientists have devoted their careers to this singular work. The Classification of Life does not impose order upon the natural world; it encapsulates the existing order and, in so doing, reveals to us the relationships among all forms of life, extant or extinct. Not surprisingly, the Classification of Life has become the touchstone for all the biological sciences, unifying the fields of zoology, botany, microbiology, embryology, anatomy, paleontology, geography, genetics, bioinformatics, and evolution. Nothing that we think we know about biological systems can be validated with any degree of confidence without first asking whether our conclusions are consistent with our current understanding of the Classification of Life. This chapter is devoted to examining the Classification of Life. By simple observations of its classes and their hierarchical relations, we will draw logical inferences, generate new hypotheses, and develop new ways of testing the structure of the Classification of Life.

Abstract: Let F be the category with the set of objects N and morphisms given by the functions between the standard finite sets of the corresponding cardinalities. Let Jf:F→Sets(U) be the obvious functor from this category to the category of sets in a given Grothendieck universe U. In this paper we construct, for any Jf-relative monad RR and any left RR-module LM, a C-system C(RR,LM) and explicitly compute the action of the four B-system operations on its B-sets. In the introduction we explain in detail the relevance of this result to the construction of the term C-systems of type theories.

Abstract: Negative design is a group of virtual screening methods that aims at weeding out compounds with undesired properties during the early stages of drug development. These methods are mainly designed to predict three important types of pharmacological properties: drug-likeness, frequent hitters, and toxicity. In order to achieve high screening efficiency, most negative design methods are physicochemical property-based and/or substructure-based rules or filters. Such methods have advantages of simplicity and good interpretability, but they also suffer from some defects such as inflexibility, discontinuity, and hard decision-making. In this review, the advances in negative design for the evaluations of drug-likeness, frequent hitters, and toxicity are outlined. In addition, the related Web servers and software packages developed recently for negative design are summarized. Finally, future research directions in this field are discussed.

Abstract: In this article we review publications relevant to addressing widely reported claims in both the academic and popular press that chimpanzees working memory (WM) is comparable to, if not exceeding, that of humans. WM is a complex multidimensional construct with strong parallels in humans to prefrontal cortex and cognitive development. These parallels occur in chimpanzees, but to a lesser degree. We review empirical evidence and conclude that the size of WM in chimpanzees is 2 ± 1 versus Miller’s famous 7 ± 2 in humans. Comparable differences occur in experiments on chimpanzees relating to strategic and attentional WM subsystems. Regardless of the domain, chimpanzee WM performance is comparable to that of humans around the age of 4 or 5. Next, we review evidence showing parallels among the evolution of WM capacity in hominins ancestral to Homo sapiens, the phylogenetic evolution of hominins leading to Homo sapiens, and evolution in the complexity of stone tool technology over this time period.

Abstract: Lead optimization is a process for improving a hit or a lead compound to design drug candidates with improved efficacy and drug-like properties. Advancements in molecular structure determination and computational techniques have significantly boosted lead optimization process. Molecular docking has emerged as a reliable and cost-effective technique for lead identification and optimization using computational methods. Computational tools with advanced scoring functions utilizing artificial intelligence improve predictions. However, despite the advances in computational techniques, the success is limited and further improvement in these tools is required to simulate the complex biological environments. In this chapter, we will discuss applications of molecular docking for lead optimization in drug discovery. Applications based on molecular mechanics, thermodynamics and kinetics profiling, relative free binding energies, and toxicology predictions for optimization of lead molecules are highlighted.

Abstract: The speech emotion recognition (SER) field has been active since it became a crucial feature in advanced Human–Computer Interaction (HCI), and wide real-life applications use it. In recent years, numerous SER systems have been covered by researchers, including the availability of appropriate emotional databases, selecting robustness features, and applying suitable classifiers using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). Deep models proved to perform more accurately for SER than conventional ML techniques. Nevertheless, SER is yet challenging for classification where to separate similar emotional patterns; it needs a highly discriminative feature representation. For this purpose, this survey aims to critically analyze what is being done in this field of research in light of previous studies that aim to recognize emotions using speech audio in different aspects and review the current state of SER using DL. Through a systematic literature review whereby searching selected keywords from 2012–2022, 96 papers were extracted and covered the most current findings and directions. Specifically, we covered the database (acted, evoked, and natural) and features (prosodic, spectral, voice quality, and teager energy operator), the necessary preprocessing steps. Furthermore, different DL models and their performance are examined in depth. Based on our review, we also suggested SER aspects that could be considered in the future.

Abstract: The diverse species of grapevine belong to the botanical family Vitaceae, which includes mostly shrubs and woody lianas that climb using leaf-opposed tendrils. The vast majority of the thousands of grape cultivars belong to the species Vitis vinifera. Some of the other species are used as pest-tolerant rootstocks to which cultivars with desirable fruit properties are grafted. Cultivars are propagated asexually as cuttings so that each individual is a clone of its mother plant. Grapevines comprise vegetative organs (roots, trunk, cordon, shoots, leaves, and tendrils) and reproductive organs (clusters with flowers or berry fruit). All organs are interconnected through the vascular system, comprising the xylem for water and nutrient transport and the phloem for assimilate transport. The roots form the plant–soil interface, while the trunk, cordons, and shoots of a vine form its stem. The shoots carry the leaves, buds, tendrils, and clusters. Leaves are arranged in spiral phyllotaxy in juvenile vines and in alternate phyllotaxy in mature vines. Buds are young, compressed shoots embedded in leaf scales. Tendrils and clusters are modified shoots. After fertilization, the flower pistil develops into the berry fruit. The berry houses up to four seeds surrounded by the endocarp, the mesocarp, or flesh, and the exocarp, or skin.

Abstract: Private, for-profit English conversation schools (eikaiwa) are a prominent venue of study among Japanese adults. Thus, eikaiwa marketing strategies are reflective and constitutive of discourses that structure the desire or compulsion for English learning in Japan. Synthesizing critical, multimodal, and Foucauldian discourse analysis techniques, this study examines 28 recent print eikaiwa advertisements to explicate the visual and verbal elements through which particular ideologies of English proficiency and its benefits are constructed. Findings are integrated with data from a small-scale survey of Japanese adults (n = 13) to illuminate how the advertisements are perceived by members of the target audience. Whereas these advertisements have historically exploited images of Caucasian men to incite heterosexual women’s akogare (yearning), texts in the present corpus commonly frame English learning as a rational process of acquiring quantifiable skills, which enhance workers’ self-worth by ensuring their continued value to their employers. Moreover, they often characterize English study as rigorous and inevitable albeit burdensome and demeaning. The study argues that these emerging themes are attributable to the growing influence of neoliberal ideologies and practices, and they mainly serve to propagate fantasies of English proficiency as a reliable means of obtaining stable vocations within volatile labor markets.

Abstract: Posthumous medical data donation (PMDD) for the purpose of legitimate, non-commercial and, potentially, very beneficial medical research has been sparsely discussed in legal scholarship to date. Conversely, quite an extensive social science and humanities research establishes benefits of this practice. It also finds that PMDD enables individuals to employ their altruistic motivations and aspirations by helping them participate in ‘citizen's science’ and medical research, thus supporting efforts in finding cures for some of the acutest diseases of today. There appears to be no jurisdiction where a regulatory framework supports and enables PMDD. This paper analyses whether and to what extent law and policy should enable this practice. We take a comparative approach, examining the position under both US and UK law, providing the first comparative legal account of this practice. We do not aim to suggest a detailed legal solution for PMDD, but rather key considerations and principles for legislative/policy reforms, which would support the practice of PMDD. We discuss organ donation and provide a comparative outlook with the aim of drawing lessons from this practice, and applying them to the regulation of PMDD. Our analysis is both normative and black letter since we consider arguments regarding the necessity of organ and data donation, as well as the law that regulates these practices.

Abstract: A new genus, Corisantis gen. nov., within the Andean clade (AC) of the rove-beetle subtribe Philonthina, is described and illustrated, including 14 species. This new genus comprises six valid species formerly assigned to Belonuchus Nordmann (B. candens (Erichson, 1840) and B. pulchripennis Bernhauer, 1908) and Philonthus (Ph. auripennis Bernhauer, 1916; Ph. caliensis Bernhauer, 1916; Ph. excellens Bernhauer, 1916; and Ph. whymperi Sharp, 1891), along with nine newly described species: C. ancashensis sp. nov., C. bongarensis sp. nov., C. cajamarcanus sp. nov., C. columbiensis sp. nov., C. ecuatoriensis sp. nov., C. grandis sp. nov., C. levis sp. nov., C. magdalensis sp. nov., and C. napoensis sp. nov. The four species originally classified under Philonthus are reassigned to Corisantis with the following new combinations: C. auripennis (Bernhauer, 1916) comb. nov., C. caliensis (Bernhauer, 1916) comb. nov., C. excellens (Bernhauer, 1916) comb. nov., and C. whymperi (Sharp, 1891) comb. nov. Additionally, Belonuchus pulchripennis is synonymized under Belonuchus candens (=B. pulchripennis syn. nov.), which is also transferred to Corisantis as C. candens (Erichson, 1840) comb. nov. Lectotypes are designated for B. pulchripennis Bernhauer (1908), Philonthus candens Erichson (1840) and Philonthus whymperi Sharp (1891). This study provides diagnoses, redescriptions or descriptions, illustrations, a distribution map, and an identification key for the species of Corisantis. Phylogenetic analyses, employing three methodologies—Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian Inference—consistently support the monophyly of Corisantis and confirm its sister-group relationship with Leptopeltoides Chani-Posse and Asenjo, with both genera being sister to Leptopeltus Bernhauer. Additionally, biogeographical analyses using two methodologies—BBM (Bayesian Binary MCMC) and S-DIVA (Statistical Dispersal-Vicariance Analysis)—suggest that the South American Transition Zone was the center of origin and early diversification for these three genera.

Abstract: Steganography is the process of hiding messages inside an object known as a carrier. The idea is establishing a covert communication channel where messages go unnoticed by observers having access to that channel. Steganalysis is dedicated to the detection of such hidden messages; these messages can be embedded in several different types of digital media, such as images, video, audio, plain text files, and covert channels. Traditional steganalysis schemes are divided into two stages; the first one involves manual extraction of high-end features, and the second one is classification using machine learning (ML) methods. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) can unify both traditional stages into an end-to-end scheme with promising results. In this chapter, we show the most relevant steganalysis techniques using statistical, ML, and DL methods on digital media.

Abstract: This paper presents a domain-specific threat-modeling framework for the cellular mobile networks. We survey known attacks against mobile communication and organize them into attack phases, tactical objectives, and techniques. The Bhadra framework aims to provide a structured way to analyze and communicate threats on a level that abstracts away the technical details but still provides meaningful insights into the adversarial behavior. Our goals are similar to existing threat modeling frameworks for enterprise information systems, but with a focus on mobile operator networks. The framework fills a gap that has existed in tools and methodology for sharing of threat intelligence within and between organizations in the telecommunications industry. The paper includes concrete case studies of applying the framework. It can also be read as a survey of attacks against mobile networks.

Abstract: Neuroimaging studies of aphasia recovery have linked treatment-related improvements in language processing to changes in functional brain activation in left hemisphere language regions and their right hemisphere homologues. Although there is some consensus that better behavioral outcomes are achieved when activation is restored to the left hemisphere, the circumstances that dictate how and why regions in both hemispheres respond to naming therapy are still unclear. In this study, an fMRI picture-naming task was used to examine 16 regions of interest in 26 patients with chronic aphasia before and after 12 weeks of semantic naming treatment. Ten control patients who did not receive treatment and 17 healthy controls were also scanned. Naming therapy resulted in a significant increase in cortical activation, an effect that was largely driven by patients who responded most favorably to treatment, as patients who responded less favorably (as well as those who did not receive treatment) had little change in activation over time. Relative to healthy controls, patients had higher pre-treatment activation in the bilateral inferior frontal gyri (IFG) and lower activation in the bilateral angular gyri; after treatment, they had higher activation in bilateral IFG, as well as in the right middle frontal gyrus. These results suggest that the predominant effect of beneficial naming treatment was an upregulation of traditional language areas and their right hemisphere homologues and, in particular, regions associated with phonological and semantic/executive semantic processing, as well as broader domain general functions. Additionally, in some left hemisphere regions, post-treatment changes in activation were greater when there was more damage than when there was less damage, indicating that spared tissue in otherwise highly damaged regions can be modulated by treatment.

Abstract: Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is becoming much more important because of the huge amount of textual content that grows exponentially on the Internet and the various archives of news articles, scientific papers, legal documents, etc. Manual text summarization consumes a lot of time, effort, cost, and even becomes impractical with the gigantic amount of textual content. Researchers have been trying to improve ATS techniques since the 1950s. ATS approaches are either extractive, abstractive, or hybrid. The extractive approach selects the most important sentences in the input document(s) then concatenates them to form the summary. The abstractive approach represents the input document(s) in an intermediate representation then generates the summary with sentences that are different than the original sentences. The hybrid approach combines both the extractive and abstractive approaches. Despite all the proposed methods, the generated summaries are still far away from the human-generated summaries. Most researches focus on the extractive approach. It is required to focus more on the abstractive and hybrid approaches. This research provides a comprehensive survey for the researchers by presenting the different aspects of ATS: approaches, methods, building blocks, techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and future research directions.

Abstract: This, the first chapter, overviews the current state of coal and coalbed gas in a carbon-conscious world. The 2008 global economic recession resulting in protracted lowering of natural gas prices, the 2015 Paris Climate Change Agreement, as well as the effects of the 2022 Ukraine-Russia conflict have substantially influenced fossil fuel use. However, coal and, to a lesser degree, coalbed gas are still significant as energy fuel for current use and future development. These policies are driving research by countries into how coal can be utilized in nonfuel, alternative applications. This global awareness of climate change and impacts of fossil fuel use underscores the objectives, scope, vision, and principles of this book.

Abstract: With the rapid development of multimedia technology, editing and manipulating digital images have become more accessible than ever. This paper proposed color image authentication based on blind fragile image watermarking for tamper detection and self-recovery named AuSR1. The AuSR1 divides each channel of the cover image into non-overlapping blocks with the size of 2 × 2 pixels. The authentication data is embedded into the original block location, while the recovery data is embedded into the distant location from the original location based on the block mapping algorithm. The watermark data is then embedded into the 2 LSB to achieve high quality of the recovered image under tampering attacks. In addition, the permutation algorithm is applied to ensure the security of the watermark data. The AuSR1 utilizes a three-layer authentication algorithm to achieve a high detection rate.The experimental results show that the scheme produced a PSNR value of 45.57 dB and an SSIM value of 0.9972 of the watermarked images. Furthermore, the AuSR1 detected the tampered area of the images with a high precision value of 0.9943. In addition, the recovered image achieved a PSNR value of 27.64 dB and an SSIM value of 0.9339 on a 50% tampering rate.

Abstract: This chapter explores how creativity is related to, but at the same time distinct from, innovation, imagination, intelligence, originality, and problems solving. Imagination is, for example, frequently associated with creativity. Imaginary worlds are sometimes known as paracosms. These are probably most common around nine years of age and typically fade in the teenage years. Creativity and imagination are also both apparent when an individual has an imaginary friend. Originality is more difficult to separate from creativity. This is because creative things are always original. Originality may take the form novelty, uniqueness or unusualness, or unconventionality. Creative things are always original, but originality is not sufficient for creativity. Then there is the fact that some creative efforts solve a problem or have some utility of some sort. Other creative efforts are self-expressive and intrinsically motivated. Innovation certainly requires some level of originality, but not maximal novelty, whereas other creative performances may benefit from extreme originality. Many cultural differences support the idea that invention, innovation, and creativity are distinguishable and extricable. This chapter includes discussions of the discovery and development of chaos theories have involved professional marginality of the sort that is useful for individuals and their insights. Towards the end of the chapter the question of “what is creativity” is roached by examining computer creativity and animal creativity.

Abstract: As the globally increasing population drives rapid urbanization in various parts of the world, there is a great need to deliberate on the future of the cities worth living. In particular, as modern smart cities embrace more and more data-driven artificial intelligence services, it is worth remembering that (1) technology can facilitate prosperity, wellbeing, urban livability, or social justice, but only when it has the right analog complements (such as well-thought out policies, mature institutions, responsible governance); and (2) the ultimate objective of these smart cities is to facilitate and enhance human welfare and social flourishing. Researchers have shown that various technological business models and features can in fact contribute to social problems such as extremism, polarization, misinformation, and Internet addiction. In the light of these observations, addressing the philosophical and ethical questions involved in ensuring the security, safety, and interpretability of such AI algorithms that will form the technological bedrock of future cities assumes paramount importance. Globally there are calls for technology to be made more humane and human-centered. In this paper, we analyze and explore key challenges including security, robustness, interpretability, and ethical (data and algorithmic) challenges to a successful deployment of AI in human-centric applications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of these concepts/challenges. We provide a detailed review of existing literature on these key challenges and analyze how one of these challenges may lead to others or help in solving other challenges. The paper also advises on the current limitations, pitfalls, and future directions of research in these domains, and how it can fill the current gaps and lead to better solutions. We believe such rigorous analysis will provide a baseline for future research in the domain.

Abstract: Polymer nanogels (NGs) are water-swellable, cross-linked 3D network structures with size typically range from 1 to 1000 nm. Especially, biocompatible and “smart” NGs engineered from stimuli-responsive polymers are attractive because of its capability to respond the endogenous biological triggers of pH, bioreduction, biomolecule recognition, as well as the exogenous stimuli-triggers like temperature and light. Importantly, on exposing to these physical or biochemical signals, the responsive NGs can be utilized for therapeutic delivery and diagonostic applications. In the past decade, substantial developments were achieved in the development of “smart” NGs for theranostic and diagnostic applications such as intracellular delivery of drug and nucleic acids, photodynamic/photothermal therapy, bioimaging and sensing. Herein, we exclusively review the recent exciting developments in synthetic methods as well as biomedical applications of successfully employed “smart” NGs which can respond to a single, dual or multiple stimulus- responsive triggers. The prospects in the application of the stimuli-responsive and multifunctional NGs also will be addressed in this review.

Abstract: In the last years, a lot of literature has provided considerable support for multilabel classification in machine learning. It means that each sample or instance belongs to more than one class label simultaneously. Therefore, it represents complex objects that have multiple meanings. It helps in capturing more information by labeling some basic and hidden patterns. In this respect, multilabel classification is very useful in medical data analysis. It addresses the problem of diagnosis, surgery, anatomy, disease progress, analysis, and teaching purposes in medicine. There are many patients have many diseases at the same time, maybe in the same organ, such as ocular diseases. On the other side, the multilabel classification is a challenging issue by nature. This is due to high dimensionality, sparseness, and imbalance of available data. Some problems with labels are raised, such as label dependency, locality, interlabel diversity, and similarity. Therefore, our survey introduces significant topics of the multilabel classification in medical image analysis field. Notably, most of the literature did not show how multilabel classification affect the medical image analysis. In this chapter, we presented the different examples of medical image classification by the multilabel methods. We present the detailed analysis and discussions of the literature findings. The performance of the methods is compared on five publicly available data sets such as yeast, scene, genebase, corel5k and BibTex of multilabel classification using famous measures. Moreover, we intend to give the researcher a computer-aided CAD system framework for the existing multilabel classification research.

Abstract: People differ in how readily they enact their intentions. Some people manage to enact very difficult intentions (e.g., writing a book or starting a business) under demanding circumstances (e.g., extreme stress or oppressive bureaucracy). Other people struggle to enact even mundane intentions (e.g., replying to an email or taking out the trash). These individual differences in intention enactment have been the central focus of action-theoretical research. Section 1 of this chapter traces the historical development of the action-theoretical perspective, from prescientific notions to Action Control Theory (ACT; Kuhl, 1984). Section 2 presents an update of ACT in the form of ACTψ (‘act-psi’). According to ACTψ, efficient action control requires the person to use affect regulation to coordinate the interplay of intention memory and intuitive behavior control. Chronic individual differences in affect regulation presumably underlie the personality disposition of action versus state orientation. Section 3 considers the measurement of action versus state orientation. Section 4 reviews research showing that, as compared with state-oriented people, action-oriented people: (a) Enact demanding and self-directed intentions more efficiently in real life and controlled settings; (b) Form, maintain, and update their intentions more readily; (c) Regulate own affective states more rapidly, are better shielded against stress and mental illness, and display more personal growth. Finally, Section 5 considers how the action-theoretical perspective complements social-psychological approaches to intention–behavior relations.

Abstract: Beauty connects us viscerally to the material universe. Life forms evolved to experience biological connectedness as an absolute necessity for survival. Starting one century ago, however, dominant culture deliberately reversed the mechanism responsible for visceral connection. The resulting disconnection from the material world will continue to have long-lasting negative consequences for human well-being. Christopher Alexander describes how to revive the visceral connecting process, creating conditions for human-centered design in our times. Biological connectedness arises from an organic projection of the designer’s “self” onto the material reality of the object being designed, and to its physical context. Exploring multiple scenarios using informational feedback avoids letting the designer’s ego or imposed images exert a controlling influence. Implementing Alexander’s connecting method could revolutionize design, with the potential to produce a new, nourishing art and architecture. Recent developments in biophilia and neuro-design help to better understand Alexander’s ideas, using results not available at the time he was developing his theory.

Visuospatial short-term and working memory disturbance in the primary progressive aphasias: Neuroanatomical and clinical implications,

Abstract: Introduction
Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) comprises three main variants: logopenic (lv-PPA), non-fluent (nfv-PPA) and semantic variant (sv-PPA). Differentiating the language profiles of the PPA variants remains challenging, especially for lv-PPA and nfv-PPA. As such, diagnostic tools that do not rely on speech and language may offer some utility. Here, we investigated the short-term and working memory profiles of the PPA variants and typical Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a particular interest in the visuospatial system. We hypothesised visuospatial short-term and working memory would be more compromised in lv-PPA and AD than in the other PPA variants, and that this would relate to degeneration of posterior temporoparietal brain regions.
Method
Thirty-three lv-PPA, 26 nfv-PPA, 31 sv-PPA and 58 AD patients, and 45 matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants completed the WMS-III Spatial and Digit Span tasks and underwent a structural brain MRI for voxel-based morphometry analyses.
Results
Relative to Controls, Spatial Span Forward (SSF) performance was impaired in lv-PPA and AD but not in nfv-PPA or sv-PPA. In contrast, Digit Span Forward (DSF) performance was impaired in lv-PPA and nfv-PPA (to a similar level), and AD, but was relatively intact in sv-PPA. As expected, most backward span scores across both modalities were lower than forward span scores. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that SSF and SSB performance in all patients combined correlated with grey matter intensity decrease in several clusters located in temporo-parieto-occipital brain regions. Post-hoc group comparisons of these regions showed that grey matter loss was more extensive in the lv-PPA and AD groups than in the nfv-PPA and sv-PPA groups.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that the visuospatial short-term and working memory profiles of the PPA variants are separable and likely reflect their distinct patterns of temporo-parieto-occipital brain atrophy.

Abstract: This review summarized the applied techniques and applied nanomaterials (NMs) for the progress of latent fingerprints (LFPs) images on several surfaces. Used numerous types of NMs and their benefits along with their quality of the LFPs images on the porous and non-porous substrates. Several conventional techniques used for the examining of FPs pictures such as physical (powder dusting), chemical (cyanoacrylate, ninhydrin, AgNO3, fluorescent dye, etc.), and instrumental (gas chromatography, Raman scattering, Fourier transform infrared, etc.) have been discussed and gradually compromised their disadvantage in the current forensic science demand such as high contrast, good visualization, high sensitivity & selectivity, minimized auto-fluorescent, and low toxicity. The benefits and experimental results conducted by the researchers on various kinds of metal, metal oxides, plasmonic NPs, fluorescent NPs (conjugated polymer NPs, quantum dots(QDs), nonmetallic NPs, mesoporous silica NPs, and lanthanide (Ln3+) NPs, etc.) for the expansion of LFPs images on dissimilar surfaces. Despite the use of NPs in forensic sciences for the detection of LFPs pictures, the main emphasis is on luminescent Ln3+-NPs/ upconversion (UC) NPs. These luminescent Ln3+NPs/ UCNPs can produce more contrast, high visible, highly sensitive, selective, long-life decay imaging pictures of LFPs on different substrates (porous and non-porous) with minimized toxicity, which is lacking in most of the traditional fluorescent NMs. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive a systematic overview of current trends on LFPs imaging development in forensic sciences. Currently, more studies are required to develop the most efficient, high-performance, surface-functionalized, highly biocompatible, and nontoxic Ln3+ NPs/ UCNPs for the recognition of LFPs images on different surfaces.

Abstract: Open-set domain adaptation is a developing and practical solution to training deep networks using unlabeled data which have been collected among unknown data and are under domain shift with other labeled data. This scenario transfers knowledge from a source domain enriched with labeled data to the unlabeled target domain, meanwhile, unknown target samples which are not present in the source domain are separated. Existing methods aim to bridge the domain gap of shared classes between source and target domains in a trustworthy manner and avoid negative transfer learning using keeping away unknown data from the domain alignment step. In this review article, we present a unified framework of theory advances for network risk and a new categorization of open-set domain adaptation along with listing evaluation metrics and popular datasets. Then we accentuate challenges and gaps in existing studies to organize a road map for future research using detailed analysis of investigations. To bring things full circle, we also point out different assumptions and outlooks in the settings of this research area.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) such as BERT and GPT have recently achieved great success and become a milestone in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Owing to sophisticated pre-training objectives and huge model parameters, large-scale PTMs can effectively capture knowledge from massive labeled and unlabeled data. By storing knowledge into huge parameters and fine-tuning on specific tasks, the rich knowledge implicitly encoded in huge parameters can benefit a variety of downstream tasks, which has been extensively demonstrated via experimental verification and empirical analysis. It is now the consensus of the AI community to adopt PTMs as backbone for downstream tasks rather than learning models from scratch. In this paper, we take a deep look into the history of pre-training, especially its special relation with transfer learning and self-supervised learning, to reveal the crucial position of PTMs in the AI development spectrum. Further, we comprehensively review the latest breakthroughs of PTMs. These breakthroughs are driven by the surge of computational power and the increasing availability of data, towards four important directions: designing effective architectures, utilizing rich contexts, improving computational efficiency, and conducting interpretation and theoretical analysis. Finally, we discuss a series of open problems and research directions of PTMs, and hope our view can inspire and advance the future study of PTMs.
